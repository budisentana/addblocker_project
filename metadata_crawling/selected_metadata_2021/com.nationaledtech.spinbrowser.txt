Have the peace of mind knowing you can't access any adult content, and if you do then the Spin team is one email away from blocking the troubling URL! However, the Spin browser suffers from bugs. It crashes, especially when too many tabs are open, and if you close any tabs before closing the browser, the browser will reopen all of your closed tabs the next time you open the browser. Going back to edit text in the browser results in random text placement and erasure of previous.","This is a great app, however do you have any plan on adding some sort of synchronisation with google services for instance, to have passwords, bookmarks, history and all synced? That would make it so much better!","Y'all did it finally ,,, y'all built my spin safe browser ,,, that spins clockwise in color ,,, any breach in security should spin counterclockwise and change to a different notification color in protocol security design ,,, if it doesn't do all that , then you didn't build it right !!!","Firefox add-ons make it even better. I installed \"Dark-Reader\" and an ad-blocker. So far, so good. Hope it gets updated with new Firefox binaries"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.nationaledtech.spinbrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nationaledtech.spinbrowser&hl=en&gl=au"}
