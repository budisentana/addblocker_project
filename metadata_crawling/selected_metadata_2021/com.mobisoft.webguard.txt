BUT I see the price is being increased from Â£5.99 to Â£27.49 when my subscription renews in June 2021. How can this be justified? This is crazy. I and my friends who installed it on my recommendation won't be renewing our subscriptions. No way.","Brilliant App ... since I've had this app on my phone, not one ad has appeared. it has exceeded my expectations of what it will do as I expected at least a \"few\" ads might appear. But NO ADS have appeared since I installed it. I highly recommend this app to anyone with an annoying ad problem on their phone, like I had ... you wont be disappointed.","Every thing was fine until Google sent me a notification with a 6 times increase in yearly subscription. Are u kidding me? Bye bye web guard can't afford $50 a year.","Seems to be doing its job. :) Threats and ads have been blocked, and it doesn't seem to be a drain on my battery like I was worried it might be. Only suggestion is that it would be nice to have the option to disable the notification at the top of the screen - - I already know it's running when I see the key icon after I enable a network, and don't really like seeing the other message all the time. But I'm nitpicky about my devices that way. :P"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mobisoft.webguard","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobisoft.webguard&hl=en&gl=au"}
