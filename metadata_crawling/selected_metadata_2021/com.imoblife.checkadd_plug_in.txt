I was skeptical from reviews but, agreed, RTFM idiots! Plugin not perfect, tho. Was looking for source of an Edge add that pops up a new tab, & an add that launches Chrome on its own even when Chrome is disabled! These browsers dont even show in the Ad Detect app list!? Also, icons in list shuffle randomly when reappearing from being scrolled out of view!? Developers: I have timestamped screenshots of shuffling for you. Adds were not prolific. UniMax U693CL, Android 9","For those that gave this 1 star, please read the app infornation first before mindlessly installing. This is a 'plug-in' NOT designed as a stand-alone application, it needs 'All-in-One Toolbox' app to work, as stated in the description. Having said that, it works as designed, identifying apps with ads within them. Trouble is 99.9% of all FREE apps contain ads. Its the price you pay for free. So basically, I uninstalled because I would have to remove nearly all of my apps.","I've always respected All-In-One Toolbox. Naturally, I've installed the plugins. I see a few reviews stating that this plug-in works. Disappointed -- NOT on my nearly new LG V30 phone. A couple weeks ago, i started getting obnoxious splash screen junk ads. SEVERAL of them repeating, every session on my device. Two (2) of them are even piled atop one another, when i power up my phone. This plugin pops up on my screen, but hasn't helped a bit, STOPPING ALL OF THE ADS!","Adds more pop-up ads, rather than identifying anything. It will show you a list of installed apps that it thinks contain advertising, but will not identify the program that took over your phone with an ad. In fact, this app will guarantee a full screen pop-up every time you check your phone.","This is a plugin for another app... not sure why that isn't the first line of the description, could have saved the developer a few bad reviews. The app and this plugin do what they say, but they also annoyingly and ironically spam ads everywhere. (The plugin *does\" detect itself as having ads.) Used to identify problem apps, then promptly uninstalled, this plugin and the app it plugs into work great."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.imoblife.checkadd_plug_in","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imoblife.checkadd_plug_in&hl=en&gl=au"}
