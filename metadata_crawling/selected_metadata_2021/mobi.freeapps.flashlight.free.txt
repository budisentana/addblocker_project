Even a dinosaur like myself figured it out. What ads there are don't interfere with my use of the light. And I'm very pleased that I'm allowed to edit my review, even after I posted it (I think in iterations, successive approximations, rarely get it right the first time through), though that may not be the developer's doing(?). Anyway, thanks to you, singly or as a group, well done.","Works great, nice and bright, ads at the bottom not in the way. And when I shake my LG phone it turns on automatically. Shake it again a few times and it turns off which I just learned. That's cool and also explains why the flashlight would be on sometimes when I didn't want it on and hadn't turned it on. That's not so cool. But now at least I know so can prevent that but also can use the feature when needed. That's super cool!","Nice flashlight app! I like spinning my phone till the flash turns on/off! Forgot to add this before but one recommendation I have for this is changing the shake sensitivity, since when I shake my phone, it takes a while and I'd like to make it more convenient! Thanks!","Though it does not have as meny features as some others for me this was just what I needed. It also can be set to turn on when you shake it. This is the nicest part in my opinion. I like this because though it has a feature like this, it is not over the top and is still simple.","This is a good flashlight app. The light is bright, it's ad free and easy to use. I like the brightness when I have to walk in the dark, but would like a lower setting for a reading light. When I read a review from someone with epilepsy asking for a lower setting that wouldn't set off symptoms and customer service saying it can't be done I was annoyed..... yes it can. And since it effects her health it should. When I find one that does I'll switch."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"mobi.freeapps.flashlight.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.freeapps.flashlight.free&hl=en&gl=au"}
