It also would randomly yet persistently clear all my open tabs. I called it quits when it repeatedly played a midroll ad on a video. Nope. Not playing this game again. Goodbye. 2 stars bc it did used to work and I did like the loophole it provided for anti-adblock sites","this app keeps stopping while installed, so i cannot choose it as a default app like it wants, it is totally unstable and unreliable. i havd used this app on 4 previous phones with NO issues, so this is a first, a constant problem, and a total disappointment. The update does seem to work better, thanks for the help.","Since I downloaded this app & gave them permission to access my camera & microphone, my camera light turns on randomly & I hear the shutter noise occasionally when its on. I've checked to see if maybe I accidentally took a picture but nothing pops up on my gallery. I had to buy a camera lens cover for my laptop. I recently noticed that they ask for permission to record videos, take pictures & record audio instead of simply asking for permission to access camera or mic. This app is dangerous","I quickly uninstalled this browser. I have found that I can get the same benefits bye using other apps to clear ads and to protect my identity. I use dfndr very inexpensive! Plus you can pick where you are located. I was very disappointed with this browser! I felt like there were too many ads....","I'm not sure about where does the adblock rocket shield extension exists as if now but i have used it a long time ago. This browser might be a incognito fork of chromium but zero for privacy & in-built security. No option for user agent, dark theme for webpages, screenshot (should be in settings), no fingerprint protection, adblocker which should be USP misses too many ads, no trackers protection. Make it lightweight and also a geckoview like Firefox version which can be customised like Tor.üëç"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.hsv.privatebrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hsv.privatebrowser&hl=en&gl=au"}
