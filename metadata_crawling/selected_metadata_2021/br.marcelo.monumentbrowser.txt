Alright. I paid for the paid version (although it was an accident) but absolutely nothing changed. And then there are other problems such as images not loading, pages not loading unless I restart the app and soooo many other problems. The speed of this browser is amazing tho. Love the interface too.","I'm ready to buy premium version but app itself is buggy and has issues and missing features needed for me to replace chrome or Firefox. No dark mode for webpages (like Opera) (not AMOLED black like it is 2 the bars). No font change option. Ads & trackers still bypass. Black bar is there when search bar is selected 2 show on top under full-screen mode (still exists). Pop-up window now doesn't occur & no background player for audio and videos. Add a syncing acct option.Please improve for 5 stars.","A fast browser. Please provide the feature to re-arrange the order of icons in speed dial. Please also show the number of tabs opened on the tab icon."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"br.marcelo.monumentbrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.marcelo.monumentbrowser&hl=en&gl=au"}
