I unknowingly downloaded a malware app. Which kept on pushing junk ad. Thanks to ad defector app.. i was able to detect it and uninstalled it. Thanks. And this is a genuine review not a paid one.","Thank you!!! The scan took literally one second and found an unnamed app that was not only the one showing both small and full screen pop up ads (porn ones at that) on my phone but also had access to my location, camera and more! Its finally gone! You do need to look through the list and find the guilty app. One suggestion would be to set a start time so it could run until an ad is shown and log ad events to see what app launched it, if possible, but this worked great for me! Thank you!","Fantastic app. Easy to use. Ran a scan. Clicked through a couple likely culprits (all games, or any apps I didn't recognize), dismissing ones that had used zero data. Sure enough, solitaire, which I'd never installed nor played, had used data. Removed and problem solved. app team should include when installed and bandwidth used since X on the overall summary page; my only gripe was that this info wasn't on the summary, but not enough to mark this app down (I personally didn't have many).","Did the Job: it list all the apps that run ads but here's the tricky part. you yourself have to look for the recently downloaded apps that could be causing your new problem with Ads. 1. look at your phone for apps you recently downloaded. (and didn't download). 2. run the Apps scan. 3. In the list, find the names of ones you recently downloaded. click on them. look to see if they have used unusual amounts of memory. 4. force stop the suspicious memory using apps. 5. see if the ads stop.","This worked for me where several other big names failed, including Avast, Zonealarm and Malwarebytes. Even AVG. An app I had previously uninstalled was still on my phone somehow and I never would have known! That being said, it will show you EVERY app on your system that uses adware. As long as you know the difference between fair and malicious adware, you're golden. A thousand thank yous to the person who wrote this software and put it here simply flr the greater good."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"krow.dev.addetector","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=krow.dev.addetector&hl=en&gl=au"}
