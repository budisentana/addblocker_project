For those who don't know this app is great because it does not \"discard\" your tabs from RAM when you browse another app for 30 second like Brave and Chrome both do (they don't let you change this for some reason).","A mouth-watering range of settings! So many that shortcuts to the various sections and/or search within settings are needed. I had great fun customising, and looked forward to adopting this as my default browser - despite its huge MB footprint, normally a very big deal for me. But it's appallingly, unusably slow. Speed mode does help but not enough. In every other way, I love it... I'll be checking back in future in the hope that an update fixes this - concept and design are right up my street.","It was my go to browser in the Windows Phone days, it was one of the best. I am so happy that i can use it now on android os. And yes, is my default browser now. The trademark of the browser is the Launchpad, trust me, once you start using it you will never stop. In the WP days, Daniel the developer behind Surfy was very responsive with Surfy fans, nothing changed here too. So instead giving low rate whenever you see something's wrong, just report it to the developer, he reads everything.","tried out as replacement for habit browser. i like the menu customizations, but it just cant match habit browser in terms of overall customization. wish theres an option to remove tabs at the top as theres really no reason for them to eat precious screen real estate. also, website scaling seems to not work all the time. there are sites i open where all i can see is the banner at the top when it loads and have to pinch. also wish i can move the menu from left to right at landscape","Great mobile browser. Offers great privacy with cookies deleted on exit(optional in settings). It's fast and has a unique UI, but one let down about is the browsing experience with the tabs. This needs to be changed to a separate page to view all tabs, as swiping through over 6 tabs on a small mobile device is not exactly efficient. The positives of this UI is that it's highly customizable! It gives you the feel of using a desktop browser on mobile. But needs dark web pages, please."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.outcoder.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outcoder.browser&hl=en&gl=au"}
