It is now my default browser and I recommend u make it yours too","Our personally love this app. Some people may find it underdeveloped, but it gets the job done. I often watch anime on websites that are loaded with ads, and everytime you click on the a video even to rewind it ten seconds, it will bring up five different windows with ads. This browser automatically deletes all those ads and pop ups, and to top it off, the speed of the browser is on par if not better than the more common browsers people use","Everything is amazing about it! But it has problems, if I'm in the middle of a page and I leave the app and come back the page restarts and sends me back to the top of page. The pages also never finish loading. If this gets fixed I'll 100% give the app 5 starts but for now it's a 4 for me. I can't open my bookmarks or the settings. A lot of the problems could easily be fixed","I've been looking for alternatives to google and I'm really enjoying this, I just have issues with the settings button not responding until I've tapped it like 10times. I also wish I could have the option to have no trending video when I open the browser up, if I'm listening to music or podcasts it cuts it off.","This app is garbage. The buttons don't work. You'll have to press around them to use them. You can't pick your search engine, so you're stuck with yahoo. It's really slow. Sometimes i would leave the app with a tap open and when I'm back the tap just stopes working. It doesn't allow you to use any website you want. I had to find the website that i wanted on another browser and copy paste it on cake. The pop up blocking isn't good. It's all in all a bad."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cake.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cake.browser&hl=en&gl=au"}
