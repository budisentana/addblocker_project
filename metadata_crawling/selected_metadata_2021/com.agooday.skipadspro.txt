I have to reset the app in the accessibility settings at least 3 times a day. It's realy annoying. Otherwise it does what it promises but there was no need to buy the full version, the same app is in the google store for free. I only bought it because I thought it wouldn't turn off like the other app. Waste of money. Also, this app has no support, there hasn't been a single update since I installed it.","Does great job but of course you can get other apps that cut out apps that don't even show the adds but with those you tend to not to get all the functionality you do with this app as you lose different functions with the apps that cut the adds completely out with app you don't and it saves you having to close the commercial yourself so great app and would recommend it!!","Makes YouTube bearable. I paid for the full version and it's fantastic. Ads immediately mute and disappear the second the skip option appears. Works great on Pixel4a.","Whoever created this, YOU SUCK! This app SHOULD block ads, not just click the \"skip\" button when it appears. I got my refund back and won't get anything by this person again.","Useful edit: \"Auto Skip Ads Youtube\" does what this offer for free + more and actually works with an option to donate. If possible refund this and consider giving your 2$ to the working product! :) Doesn't actually mute which is the entire point if paying 2$, the free version does what this does already. Might as well edit ontop, claims to work on current version and up to date, this is entirely false this is just a huge SCAM."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.agooday.skipadspro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agooday.skipadspro&hl=en&gl=au"}
