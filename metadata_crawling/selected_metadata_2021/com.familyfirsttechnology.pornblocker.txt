I've tried a few different apps like it but this one is the most comprehensive and, it would seem, effective. The subscription is reasonably priced and absolutely worth it. Please keep up the good work! Only thing I'd like to see is more info about what exactly BURROW protocol is before I commit to using it for my web traffic, but that's minor, and to be fair it did get the blacklist working on my ISP!","I tried the free trial and then subscribed; so far I'm liking it! Sadly don't have anyone I can trust (or tell) to set my pin and I don't want randomized just in case so...I wrote down like 5 pins on a single paper and picked/set one real quick. I've since forgotten which one I picked and hidden the paper in a difficult-to-get-to-at-night place (I'd literally have to go outside and risk waking ppl up). The app works as intended with normal mode plus a few blacklisted sites. I can't ask for more!","I was wondering why everyone else was getting amazing customer service and they would never even respond to my emails. Apparently Gmail took the liberty to block their customer support email for me. They reached out over Google hangouts to amend the issue when they figured out what was going on. Great app. And now I can actually say great service too!","I think it deserves it the 5 star rating. So many features are fit into this app and it doesn't cost too much. The ability to add an accountability buddy is a good touch, and I'm able to add apps and websites to my blocklist without entering a pin (in case I'm in a pinch). This app just does it's absolute best to make my life be easier. The panic button, streak count, and thrive section are all super useful, and things I've searched for in other apps before using this one.","I was skeptical at first as to whether this would be effective. I'm on Day 7 and am blown away. I'm not sure the algorithm but I've tested it for loopholes and though I can get 'close' it blocks those sites that take me down the rabbit hole. The streak count is surprisingly helpful too as I don't want to blow it. I'm on Day 168 and it's been very effective. Have added it to my laptop as well."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.familyfirsttechnology.pornblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.familyfirsttechnology.pornblocker&hl=en&gl=au"}
