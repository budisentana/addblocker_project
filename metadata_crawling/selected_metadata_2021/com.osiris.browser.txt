Haven't been updated in a year and many many pages won't load. Including eBay and other normal popular sites. Also doesn't block ads. This is just junk. Keep deleting this review I will keep posting it","I bought a new phone and installed Osiris but can't find the sync feature like other browsers. How to sync bookmarks from old phone to new phone. Do I need to add them all over again to my new phone. Have around 300 bookmarks. I can't see sync feature under settings!!!","I needed an app that would run a specific grading program so that I could take attendance and enter the occasional grade. I tried a couple of other apps, but they were slow and cumbersome. This will bookmark the site I need and the response time is inline with most normal servers. I don't use this for my day-to-day surfing, but it has flash, or the flash-like capabilities that I needed. I see it as a nice alternative when you need that flexibility.",". This browser is everything you want in a private app. It's fast. It's effective--it does just what it says it does. It's simple--nothing fluffy or unnecessary here. It's smart--this is probably my favorite--this app knows what kinds of actions might indicate a change in the real world privacy environment of me, the use, and blanks the screen to preserve privacy. And that's what it's all about right? Great App!","I know that I'm the only person here with this review but honestly this app is the best. It's completely private and doesn't allow you to see anything of provirus history. Just make sure to click the Samsung home or menu phone button and give it a sec after clicking back on it and it all goes away. Props towards the maker of this app, thank you!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.osiris.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.osiris.browser&hl=en&gl=au"}
