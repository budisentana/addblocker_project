I used it for crunchyroll which has like 6 ads per ad break. But lately, it's been shutting down randomly and not working until I go back and turn it back on. And that happens very frequently.","Very effective against blocking most banner and pop-up ads in most of the apps that I use. Doesn't work in YouTube, although I have it in my \"not bypassed\" list. Has to be turned back on after a specific time has passed, but starts working immediately after being restarted. Highly recommend, for what it's worth!","Works well and would like to give it 5 stars, but unfortunately even though in settings it is set to stay on,it shuts down occasionally and then the ads start back Pity","Very good blocker. Unfortunately it keeps turning itself (or some other App or Apps keeps turning it off) and I have to manually keep restarting it I am using an S20 FE","good app, ads are blocking but not in youtube app, and some other apps still banners ads flowing, this could be clear? plz add dark mode and history clearing option, thank you."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rucksack.adblock","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rucksack.adblock&hl=en&gl=au"}
