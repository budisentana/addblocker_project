I can't find my review to reply so I will just do it here. The apps is working on my new hp now. Initially it kept showing apps not working and I can't open the apps now I am able to. This apps is really gd can block most of the ads worth paying. Thanks again!","I am praisingI am so thankful for this Unicorn block site. I'm not quite for certain how long it takes to get things going but when your phone starts messing up and you can't seem to get it programmed to the right function install this unicorn site and just set the phone down go take a breather come back to it and boom there it is yay thank you so much","I'm so happy with my purchase. I was hesitant to actually spend money on it because other adblocker's sucked so much, even with 5 running at once. So I experimented with many, MANY of them to test the amount of ads blocked, and Unicorn beat all the others hands down. They don't get all of the ads, but none do, but combined with 2 others to catch a few stragglers it's been awesome. I seriously reccomend UNICORN. I don't think you'll find one better.","It works quite well, in general terms, but still, it doesn't block all spyware and adware robots, as I supposed is intended to do. I still get a lot of unauthorized advertisement which kicks me out of the apps I'm using. P.D.: As a reply to the developer's message, the app is authorized and fully, correctly configured on my Samsung device, and the adds I was referring to appeared on Samsung internet, for some reason, just after I installed malware bytes and ran a scan, I haven't been bugged.","Going from other ad blockers, I was a bit skeptical given this is a paid alternative. Having installing and testing it throughly, I can say I'm impressed. No time during my testing did I see a hint of a pop-up or redirect. I love using my Samsung browser on my device and this add on makes an already great browser much more secure and speedy. Great job!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"kr.co.lylstudio.unicorn","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kr.co.lylstudio.unicorn&hl=en&gl=au"}
