That was before the app became toxic! The app developers watch when you first load it. They let it run smoothly at first till your comfortable with its performance. If you do not opp for the no commercials at a cost, that is when the app fails and becomes toxic to have. The developers of the app are not into it for free and no paid advertising does not put money in the bank for them and I understand. But that is when they spring there mousetrap on you. Pay up!!","I absolutely love this app. Some ads still manage to get through but all in all the app works great and I totally recommend it. Thank you developers!","It is best app for YouTube ad skip but it is working only initial 2 to 3 days after that it's sometimes work and sometimes not . So please fix the bug then it will be best app .","Just a small tip to everyone whenever it stops working you have to uninstall and install again...it works fine later thenüëå"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.plustwo.skipads","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plustwo.skipads&hl=en&gl=au"}
