I wanted to delete my browser app to fight smart phone addiction, but there's one website that I need to access on mobile for work. this app perfectly solves that problem for me. one feature I'd like is the ability to create bookmarks on my home screen that take me directly to specific whitelisted sites so that I don't have to pass through the browser home page.","I've tried tons and tons of amazing app/phone/ web block apps, and none of them I found have this amazing website whitelist feature. Thank you so much! But can you add a strict mode that, once activated (you can choose a time in the day where it deactivates), in your chosen time period, you cannot add or delete websites listed even with password and cannot delete the app? This can be helpful for some serious internet addicts."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.yehudak.whitelistbrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yehudak.whitelistbrowser&hl=en&gl=au"}
