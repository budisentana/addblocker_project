They have kept my phone, tablet, and laptop virus free. Also 'pro tip' is you start the checkout process, then try to exit it, usually they'll offer you a discount on whatever you're trying to exit the purchasing process of. Like antivirus or browser security. Sometimes you can get yearly subscriptions of things like premium antivirus software for 10 devices for less than $20 for the first year!","I like avast products but this one doesn't work well. I paid for pro and if I can get it to search for a site the page comes up backwards with Arabic writing even though I have the vpn on set to the US and if a change any settings using the custom mode or use the secure and private mode all my searches result in a white screen.","I have solved the problem with Two-Step Authentication when signing in to YouTube . With everything else considered, I think this is a great app and well worth the subscription cost. Great app and good protection.","Great just subscribed to pro! I don't feel too great about all the tracking that goes on these days, so makes me feel a bit better that I'm not so easy to track. Great for unblocking geo restrictions and blocking adds etc cheers!","Very good browser for sure. But frequent bugs and VPN, DOS, and site Down ruined everything. Do I recommend it? Not for people who hate waiting."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.avast.android.secure.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avast.android.secure.browser&hl=en&gl=au"}
