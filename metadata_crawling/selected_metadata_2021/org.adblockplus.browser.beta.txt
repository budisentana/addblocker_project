The ads are almost acting like Microsoft viruses. UPDATE: Now I know the ads show up like Microsoft viruses: Adblock is a Google product. As of this very last update. The app has been opening up NON-STOP in the background and eating up storage info. Not exaggerating. IT STARTS ITSELF UP AND DIGS THROUGH STORAGE INFO.","Can you add background add-on, and full screen display for mobile devices, the add-on feature are superbly useful","Im not usually one to comment on apps, but this is one of the five add blocker browsers I dowloaded and I can say that it may be slow to load just about anything but it works really well like I CAN USE IT ON CRUNCHYROLL AND NOT PAY MONTHAY FOR A PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP, im so happy I found this app and now im going to use it a lot. In conclusion its worth time and effort, I hope updates will stop the lag but the adds took more of my time then this app. Update: the lag has been fixed for the most part","A true blessing in this times, where ads have taken away any pleasure you might have of when browsing. Yes, you need a specific browser to avoid most of them, add-ons are notorious for their doing almost nothing.","lots of flags are there but not working as they should eg tab grid layout new tab tile"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.adblockplus.browser.beta","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adblockplus.browser.beta&hl=en&gl=au"}
