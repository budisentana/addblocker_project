They have released a patch that changes your DNS to a different one, but even with that one I still get ads. It's a great app and it doesn't deserve it's 3.1 star rating right now. The only reason why it's gotten it is because one star reviews because of the update. Give it a few weeks and it will probably be back to its former glory, blocking any and all ads I get but will never see.","It used to work better than now, even though I had some payment issues when using it and that it turned off almost always, it still being a good app, some adds still being blocked and some not, it has been giving me several connection problems when using it since last update, yet works fine in some cases, hope it can be fixed.","I loved using this app to block annoying ads on apps and now everything that connects to the internet is struggling to load. I can't access any website (even basic searches!) and it keeps disabling a different VPN I own which is making me pretty mad at this point. I'm not sure what's going on, but while Blokada is working on a solution, I'm going to keep the app completely disabled.","After a whole year of having it installed, I think I can safely say it's one of the best ad blockers available. It lets me access anything on the web, I've only ever seen ads on YouTube which is fine, and it's free! My only complaint is when I can't access anything at all but all I have to do is just reset the app and it's back to normal.","I loved this until the update now it just doesn't work anymore I was watching something with a lot of ads but the ads just kept playing nonstop and I had to uninstall it and install it again hoping it would work but it didn't this is a shame because I really loved it I should just say that u should remove whatever you put in the update so I can give good recommendations.
