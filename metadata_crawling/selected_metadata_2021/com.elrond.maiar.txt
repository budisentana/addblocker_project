No automations like ex.\"do this or that on exit\" and while switching tabs it looks really bad. When opening a new tab its neither a background opening nor a front opening its something in between and holding a link, the menu is centered and not bottom right lowered TO MAKE IT EASIER TO REACH WITH YOUR THUMB because it was easier to just put \"center\" in the code and call it a day","I like this browser's privacy features, especially that it's built on a blockchain framework. But the Share function doesn't work on my Android tablet where the browser is installed. Also, the Settings page opens halfway down on my tablet. These issues don't occur with Firefix nor Opera with VPN, both of which I use routinely.","Good browser. Biggest letdown...no text reflow. But after using it daily for an entire month I can tell you this browser is fantastic.","This browser is simply beautiful, and it does everything you could want, without the power consumption like all the rest..it very very very fast...faster than Mohammad Ali in his prime and faster than a Ferrari in top gear...","This app is great. It does have a powerful adblocker which is far better than UC Browser. One thing you may add tho is a video downloader like in the UC browser. But over all it was a great experience."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.elrond.maiar","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elrond.maiar&hl=en&gl=au"}
