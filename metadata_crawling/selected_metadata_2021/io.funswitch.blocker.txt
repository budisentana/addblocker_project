However, there is an issue in which it doesn't let me use instagram and blocks me from using it. After some time it becomes frustrating to disable the blocker in order to use instagram. Aside from that, it is an excellent app and I hope you can fix this issue soon! Edit: Thanks for the clarification, I appreciate it!","Premium is well worth the cost. Get it. It works. There is one way around it (but I won't tell) but it is so frustrating to do it has been just as much a deterrent as the actual blocker. Part of struggling with addiction will be learning self-control so don't go looking for it and just keep resisting. I thank God for this app. And I thank him for being the other half of the equation I needed to be free from this. I'd even recommend turning to him before this app.","Way overpriced, works inconsistently on Firefox, does not actually prevent you from accessing sites that are not explicitly adult content sites (e.g. instagram) even if you have the url blocked, keyword blocker does not work whatsoever (no matter what browser you are using), cannot block images on Chrome as one can simply access them through recommended images. Update 03/16/21 The image blocker blocks you when clicking on a linked image - awful. Use the Stay Focused app instead - it works","Although working as intended in most fields, it is all too often that this app blocks innocent things or things that I type, occasionally blocking me out of sending a message to someone.","Tested it out just to see if it will work, and I'm glad to see even in incognito mode it's still blocks pornography thank you so much this is the first step to freeing myself."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.funswitch.blocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.funswitch.blocker&hl=en&gl=au"}
