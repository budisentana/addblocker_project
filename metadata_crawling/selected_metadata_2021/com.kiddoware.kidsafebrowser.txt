Fixed Find on page bug.","comments":["I had to delete this browser due it being almost useless. Yes, you can easily control what you see or dont see, but it constantly force closed itself. Thay wouldnt be such a big deal, but even with it set to 'restore previous session' it would just bring up the home page when re-opened. I paid for this and regret it. Im back on Google Chrome.","This is great and I am going to stick with it. One change That I would love to see would be a more efficient way to add sites to the whitelist. It would be great if when I'm signed in (parent) then i could just do a search in the browser and then just click on sites to add. anyway, I like your app so keep developing.","I allowed some domains for kids math games, however the browser keeps closing out of them. Would appreciate some solutions for that","don't like that you need to set up a cloud account to adjust settings of the browser. should be able to change settings with just a PIN code, like Kids Place, if you want. update: its fine to offer remote filtering. but some people dont want that. you could implement this easily but you choose not to so you can collect email addresss.","I've tried almost all the applications about parental controlling and safe browsing on the web . from \"Kaspersky\" and \"Webguard\" to \"Nod32\" and \"Bitdiffender \"but none of them is even close to what this application does . Its simple , effective and runs smoothly . I also created my own blacklist and added different URLs which i couldn't do in other apps because they just block domains not URLs .and developer was so helpful about a question i asked .I recommend it to all who care about their kids"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.kiddoware.kidsafebrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiddoware.kidsafebrowser&hl=en&gl=au"}
