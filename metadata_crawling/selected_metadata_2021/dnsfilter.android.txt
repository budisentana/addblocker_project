I mainly use the app as it blocks advert, but I don't like to block ads on everything, so could you please add two features. 1. App blacklist 2. Quicksetting tile If you could add these two features, this would be the best filter on the PlayStore, and will definitely be worth 5 stars. Thanks. 😁 Edit: I've found the app blacklist, under Advanced Settings->App Whitelist. A quick setting tile would still be appreciated. Thanks","I LOVE THIS APP! For the longest time I couldn't find an adblock that worked for mobile apps until a friend recommended me this one. At first glance it looks a bit confusing but if you look into it you'll realize it's actually quite simple to use! Granted, I haven't used it that long, but so far it's worked wonders! Would definitely recommend.","This is by far the best app I've ever used. It is an excellent VPN which connects when you open your phone, unlike so many others I've tried. And it blocks so many ads.","A great app with 2 minor issues. 1. I think this is an issue with the honor phone not the app, as it works perfectly on my tablet. The vpn system closes down at random times occasionally leaving ads to get through to the browsers and apps. 2. Some apps, YouTube I'm looking at you, seem to have their ad servers hard written so the app can't block them.","super easy to use! has even advanced options as well. I was using AdGuard at first, but it just got too annoying. Never started automatically and never blocked ads of all apps. This is the way to go now!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"dnsfilter.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dnsfilter.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
