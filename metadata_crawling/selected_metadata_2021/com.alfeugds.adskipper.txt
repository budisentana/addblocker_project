NiceüòÉ. I keep getting the same efood ads over and over on every video. I have themüò§ It's ok but could you add exceptions list? In Minion Rush ads stop appearing but I need to play them if I want to get the rewards they give. I just turned off ad skipper now but it would be better if I didn't have to turn it on and off for some apps.","Updated review: developers tip has worked and the ads are being skipped properly again! Love it üëç Initial review: Worked for a while but stopped. It was a great app until it recently stopped working. I thought maybe it just needs an update but nope, just doesn't want to work anymore","It's pretty good, as a new app I thought it was gonna be dog water poo poo trash. But all of the other skip ads things I downloaded literally stopped working. This, (so far) hasn't stopped working suddenly. Great app to use.","4 stars because I'm tired of having to turn it on every hour. Why it won't just stay on is beyond me. Tried the fix, didn't work. Now it just doesn't work at all","I gave this blocker because I still get the two annoying ads and time goes by and don't remember what I'm looking for."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.alfeugds.adskipper","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alfeugds.adskipper&hl=en&gl=au"}
