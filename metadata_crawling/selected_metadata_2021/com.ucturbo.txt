With ad blocker on, it has more ads than any browser I've seen with ad blocker off! What it will do is create five or so unwanted, unnecessary folders on your device for the developers. How many browsers do these people have? Why do they need so many? You can figure it out. They need to give up.","I ennjoy the using the app,its fast and easy to use especially when i want to download videos and other apps or content using turbo browser,my only issue is that when i copy and topics or sentences i cant seem to find my clipboard so most of my contents are lost or are replaced by the recent copied so fix that issue but all same i do really like and love it.","I give this a 4 star... This browser is good I recommend it! Has a simple UI and has fast navigation. But I want more customizations like allow us to change theme colors, what is in the toolbar. And also I would really like to see an option for us to be able to move the toolbar position. I've tried like 13 browsers for the quest of finding the best one, this is the best so far","This is one of the best internet browsers I've ever used. Everything works fine, however, these days the Facebook browser in the apps is not working properly, and many sites are not working properly. Dark mode is not working so well. I would like to draw the attention of the authorities to the importance of these issues. Then you will see that your demand for this app will increase manifold, but I still love UC Turbo, I will always keep you with me.","I cant change night mode brightness.... I cant create UC account.... Toolbar needs reload button (smart mode won't show reload button).... Sometimes images wont load. it only shows the text on it.... When i start typing to access a website which i surfed previously , it wont show up on auto complete list.... It should have option to change menu buttons with toolbox buttons to put frequently used ones out of toolbox to main menu..."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ucturbo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ucturbo&hl=en&gl=au"}
