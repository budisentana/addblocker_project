I have been having an annoying ad that was playing video for like three months and I couldn't trace where it was coming from. It was blocking my whole screen and it could come any time. I was really pissed off. Lucky enough this app helped me to identify the culprit and I uninstalled the stupid app that was bringing the annoying ads. Thanks people","Was initially a good app. Showed great potential. Became disappointed when it didn't continue to run as as expected when needed. IE. It indicates its running but when opened fully, has no display of recent apps or profiles of last sourced app data exchange, after prolonged use. \"Not... Happy... Jan ! 2 weeks have passed. App appears to be back to its full potential. Much better. Further continued use finds this app comfortably opperating as per its stated perrameters. Happy with its performance","I had a hidden pop up add. Drove me crazy. Installed this it was caused by my calculator app that i used for years. Add popped up even when not using calculator making phone unusable. Deleted app it disappeared. App watch said that was the program. Used","So, initially I tought that this app can't do much except monitor your device so i started thinking to uninstall it, but when I downloaded a barcode scanner i kept getting random pop-up ads so i checked appwatch and immediately found the problem. Totally recomend!","This app is extremely good. I was very close to ditch my Samsung phone due to annoying pop- up ads. Via this app discovered that a barcode app was the root cause. Thanks well done"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tafayor.appwatch","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tafayor.appwatch&hl=en&gl=au"}
