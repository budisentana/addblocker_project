Say you want family texts to go through, but notifications from your news app could be blocked but go to the history for later scanning. By using this, I've really quieted my phone without having to start quiet mode or flip-to-shhh. The developer has been receptive to some feature ideas that did make it in. Highly recommended to quiet your phone and to funnel what you want but don't need to know immediately.","The only app I could find that actually works to block all of android's annoying persistent notifications!","Works exactly as advertised. Clean and simple interface.","Recently pricing seems increased and subscription model adopted. Thought of buying, but now away from reach :( Atleast consider \"subpro\" one time buying option."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.notic","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notic&hl=en&gl=au"}
