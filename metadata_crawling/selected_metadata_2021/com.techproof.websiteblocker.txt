Then it really helpful.","Still need improvement it shows the video when Searching by names of ****stars in incognito mode .. fix it soon ‚ù§Ô∏è","This app does nothing. It is not compatible with any common browser like chrome or Samsung internet adblock. I haven't gotten a single feature to work. At first it looks like the whole package: it blocks keywords, websites, apps, and even has a camera feature. NONE OF THEM WORK. I have everything turned on in both the app and my phone permissions.","I don't want to give 1star because it is made by good intentions. It is not working in my galaxy note 2 so please fix it.","Really good app, but I was wondering if you could make it so that I could choose wheather or not to have YouTube comments off.
