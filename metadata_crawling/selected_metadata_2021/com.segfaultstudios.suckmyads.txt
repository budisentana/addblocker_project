{"title":"Suck My Ads!      ✦(root)✦","description":"Ads suck.\r\n\r\nThey track every search you query, video you watch, purchase you make, tinder girl you swipe on, and anything else they can quantify. You don't even have a say in what they track, how long they retain what they've tracked, or even whether or not you're tracked in the first place.\r\n\r\nAds also slow down webpages, they load and re-load whenever they feel like it - often forcing you to scroll back to the spot you were at before it loaded, and some even contain malware.\r\n\r\nAll this in the quest to try and get you to buy stuff you don't need or to click on lies that aren't real (and no, that blonde girl on the sidebar that is \"dying to meet you\" is not \"just a click away\")\r\n\r\nSo, this app adds about 50,000 known ad affiliated servers to your hosts file, instantly blocking them.\r\n\r\n50,000 not enough? Ad(d) your own! View and modify your own hosts file, point ads to pictures of cats or dogs instead. Redirect your roommate's entire traffic to a prank site about spinning meat if you want! The possibilities are endless, go ham... sudo go ham.","descriptionHTML":"Ads suck.<br><br>They track every search you query, video you watch, purchase you make, tinder girl you swipe on, and anything else they can quantify.
