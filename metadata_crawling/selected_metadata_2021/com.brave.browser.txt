I don't mind the notifications for ads and the browser does a good job of stopping certain cookies. However, video playback on the browser is ify and becomes laggy, forcing me to open videos in separate apps (YouTube) instead of using the browser. Also, when filling out text boxes on websites, there is a lot of lag, which is annoying when I make mistakes and have to delete to make corrections.","It's the best browser out there that is one of the fastest browsers out there, user friendly, privacy orientated, you can opt out of all ads in settings or earn money by clicking on them, easy to transfer data from chrome by syncing laptop data that uses brave. Some reviewers here don't know how to turn off ads lol. I keep them on so I can earn money ðŸ’°","Still grinding rewards on brave. But at least I feel safer with this browser. Love the open previous session feature! I have a feedback for you. As I wanted to share this app to my friends, it would be great if we also earn more rewards from sharing your app. Seriously, I really wanted this feature! Ps: I finally installed and use brave on all my devices! Ngl.","love brave but I have not been able to claim bat for a while. Last time I was able to claim was february. Updated my phone and brave and reset my phone. No one knows how to fix this issue yet or typically they underestimate how much users have done to try to trouble shoot it. I have a motorola z3 and tried various connections, disabled shield. No dice. Dont get it if you only want bat but it's definitely worth for the ad block and cookie blocking.","Best browser ever and I recommend to everyone!!!!! I use it in all my devices, it is fast, light, \"minimal\" use of RAM memory in multiple tabs (80 tabs at the same time with 16gb of RAM, it is insane), excellent restore sessions feature and I loooooove the tab video player window controller feature: If u can do exactly the same on switching between tabs and bookmarks preview, it will be awesome!!!!! I want to be part of the user tester team!!!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.brave.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&hl=en&gl=au"}
