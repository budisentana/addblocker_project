Very disappointing that you've gone the same way as everyone else with your so-called ad blocker that still allows ads.","I have been looking for years for a web browser to replace Firefox ...Polarity with a 3.9 rating made me hesitate ... I am sure glad I installed it and tried it anyway ... I have been using the WWW since Al Gore invented it (NOT) and this browser answers all, so far, the problems I have with other browsers ... I would suggest you give it a try and put it through the paces then compare for yourself ...as for me I'm totally satisfied I will even donate do this app","So far it's nice and fast but it's still buffers on the tablet and one ad went through when I logged on to YouTube.","This browser has a great potential. Dear developers, add the ability to rotate playing video with turned off rotation in the setting of the phone and just slide left or right to seek and you'll get 5 stars!","Used to be my go-to browser, but since the last update all it does is crash every time I try to search for something or click a link on sites like Twitter."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"pcr.browser.polarity","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pcr.browser.polarity&hl=en&gl=au"}
