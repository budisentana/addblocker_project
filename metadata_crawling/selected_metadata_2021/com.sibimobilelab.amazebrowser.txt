My only problem is that I can't upload files on one of my phones (Android 4.4), even while using it normally, and it's a pain constantly having to open another browser so I can do this. (I understand not being able to upload files while using the bubble mode feature. That's fair.) Please, Amaze devs. Fix this issue, and I will gladly give you a five star review. 👏","Needs: 1. return to previous page option in configuration without total reload so you dont have to rescroll the previous full page to get back to your reading point. 2. Dark reading mode. That white background is a eye killer. 3. ads pop up by long press to tag a site ad or button to have it blocked. This would make the ads blocker 100% more efficient. Buttons have url links to be able to be blocked too. Banners and othe site junk also. Speeds up browsing by 30-50%.. Great app just needs tweaks.","Very good. But some issues and solutions are: 1. It is difficult to switch between tabs. Make it like chrome does. 2. If I accidentally touch home button while browsing, then all previous trail is lost and I can't go back to previous page simply by clicking back button. 3. Videos don't play in full screen mode (at least on my phone). Navigation keys still take up precious space. 4. Remove navigation panel from bottom and integrate with address bar panel. 5. Enable page zoom.","Amazing is exactly what this is! It's a little tricky at first to zero in on your content, especially when you're getting it from a site that throws up a bunch of ads, but the media button at the bottom makes it easier. It's nice to start the stream in the casting device and keep your phone for yourself. So much smoother and higher quality than just mirroring the screen."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sibimobilelab.amazebrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sibimobilelab.amazebrowser&hl=en&gl=au"}
