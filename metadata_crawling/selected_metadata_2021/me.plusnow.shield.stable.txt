I wouldn't reccomend it if you're looking for something reliable.","Can't block ads if it keeps crashing, refuses to stay active for more than 10 minutes tops, constantly crashes","At first it was working and here comes ads popping back on my phone","I paid for this app. But I still see ads on 50% of the time. Sometimes even blocked by non ads pop up web site. Again, half the time I have to turn this app off and that defeat the purpose of this app. This app needs lots of updates.
