Let me know if you have any recommendations. \r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS:\r\nThe file on your device located at /etc/hosts is used to reroute internet protocols to a given location. If you direct them to the localhost then the IP will be blocked... This is how ad blockers usually work... All this app does is skim the file for specific keywords OR clear the entire file.\r\n\r\nWHY I WROTE THIS APP:\r\nI installed a custom ROM on my phone which by default came with an ad blocker. I was not aware of this until months later when I tried using a certain app which disabled functionality if you are running an Ad Blocker. This upset me because I was not aware that I was even blocking advertisements. This should have been an option on the ROM instead of configured by default. So now with this application we have the option. \r\n\r\nI am not against blocking advertisements but it should be an option or at least advertised that the ROM has a pre-installed ad blocker.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this application send me an email at aV1rusApps@gmail.com.","descriptionHTML":"****READ THIS DESCRIPTION**** <br>ROOTED PHONES ONLY<br>I cannot stress enough this is for ROOTED DEVICES!!!

I soon realized it limited my browsing ability, since some links route through ad services first. My most recent dilema was downloading packages for Babbel. After using your tool everything downloaded perfectly.","Using this on a rooted Samsung Galaxy S7. Just installed this app today so I haven’t had a chance to thoroughly test this app but it works great so far. I wasn’t very optimistic that this would work with my flashed Ad Blocker (MoaAB) since I normally needed to flash the MoaAB uninstaller to remove the ad blocking. This can save my phone from a lot of reboots. Yay! I also don't write many reviews but I wrote this one with the time I'll save with this app. Excellent so far!! :)  Hint: You might need to clear cache from apps that had ads activated during use when you restore your ad blocker (in order to remove them again).","I am running cyanogenmod 11 on a galaxy s3 with root access. I gave the app root permission and backed up successfully. I try to remove ads but I keep getting a message saying \"problem copying file/....\"","Thanks! This app really saved me! I got one annoying app deliberately nagged me saying that i have an adblocker installed which i do not. So, this app really helps me to clear the host file with a touch of a button! Simple app but worked flawlessly! To the idiots out there, go root or gtfo!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.av1rus.adblockremover","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.av1rus.adblockremover&hl=en&gl=au"}
