Doesn't even show up on the adblock options list in Samsung Internet browser hence you can't turn it on and use it for the browser.","Doesn't work at all on my android Samsung phone, I even get advertising covering my photos when I go to crop them and I can't stop it, I am getting more and more advertising covering sites that I go on ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬","AdBlock is usually my go-to adblocker on desktop, but it seems this Android one (which they redirect you to if you click Android on their site) only works on Samsung Internet and not any other mobile browsers.","Would be helpful if warning that this app is not working, stayed on screen long enough for me to read it! Continues to constantly be auto disabled - have reset, given permission on data saver, what else ? Finally deleted","It might block ads in some browsers ONLY over a wifi connection ONLY eg. This is an Extension for Samsung Internet Browser 4 and above. After installing this extension needs to be switched on. It may not block ads over 3G or 4G etc and in some cases it will require to change proxy and port settings manually. Try Blokada Slim for blocking ads in apps"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.betafish.adblocksbrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betafish.adblocksbrowser&hl=en&gl=au"}
