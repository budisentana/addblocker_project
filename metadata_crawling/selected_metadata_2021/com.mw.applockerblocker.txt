It solves the problem of different apps struggling for your data and dragging down your phone's speed. Now no more pops up. Excellent app. My phone speed is normal. I recomment for any one that is expiriencing unwanted apps having access to your data and installing themselves. Thanks to the developer.","A useful application, with it the data is safe, only I can open the applications I need, this pleases me. In addition, you can customize the lock screen, it is convenient.","A very cool application. Everything works great. It especially helps against applications that unknowingly collect information about the user.","This app is fine these apps are device admin apps and I forgot this apps password, mailed this apps developer many times to get my password back or any other way to unlock this app but I think this app developer does not see customers feedback about the app, this app makes my life hell","I loved the application thanks to it I can block applications to my liking and the screen lock is excellent, I recommend it to continue like this."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mw.applockerblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mw.applockerblocker&hl=en&gl=au"}
