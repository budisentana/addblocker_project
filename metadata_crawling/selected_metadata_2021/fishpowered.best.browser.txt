The interface is attractive and genuinely fun to use. It has everything I'm looking for in a browser, and I have tried many! It even has built-in blue light filter for light-sensitive night-browsing cave-fish such as myself. This browser is so awesome, I cry e'ry time. I LOVE YOU FISHPOWERED!!!! üò≠üëç‚ô•Ô∏è","By far the best browser I've found here. The level things that are customisable are amazing. One thing though I would like to have dark mode customizable too but also let you use a color selecter instead of premade ones, that why 1 star. Other than that the best browser I found.","I am using nextdns on my android device using DNS over TLS and fishpowered keeps giving me constant certificate error warnings making it unusable. pls help EDIT: yes, opera touch and Foss work just fine. Note: after trying several sites on opera touch, I got 1 security certificate error message. But on fishpowered, I get several of these error messages everytime I go from one page to another","Quick, functional, customizable and a very pleasant developer. Text to speech / Read aloud works very well and is a great feature.","totally different browser, fast and easy to use, but not showing the search results perfectly"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"fishpowered.best.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fishpowered.best.browser&hl=en&gl=au"}
