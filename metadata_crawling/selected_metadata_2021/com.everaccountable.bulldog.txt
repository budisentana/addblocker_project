Thanks forr joining in the fight against pornography!","comments":["Galaxy S9+ User: This is a great barrier between us and malicious sites. Only problem that i've encountered so far is that once the VPN is on, my phone becomes sluggish, not just on the web, but in every action, even as simple as unlocking the device. EDIT: After one month, even after uninstalling and re-installing the software, it still acts sluggish. Please make this a more pleasant experience.EDIT2: It has become really slow.","Great at first, I installed at home and it was great and did everything it promised, but for some reason, if I am not connected to WIFI, no websites, youtube videos, etc will load while the filter is active. My phone has full bars, a lot of memory, and its really fast with the filter off. As soon as I turn the filter back on, everything just continuously loads and never finishes. I don't like disabling the filter to use my phone while away. Please fix, such a great app when working right.","does most of it's job, but still there are lot of websites that can still be accessed, I wish it has a particular keyword blocker and particular website blocker feature as well. Kindly work on it and this would be the best blocker in the world.","Will change to 5 stars if I can have my issue resolved! It's a great app and does it's job. But I have an issue regarding YouTube comments. I can't read them and I now have to wait 48 hours too change the settings to hopefully allow me to see them in the future. It's frustrating because I wasn't warned that it prohibited YouTube comments on every video. I will keep the app once the timer runs out but maybe some could help me turn off restricted mode in YouTube comments","This app works pretty well at blocking what it's supposed to block. Only problem is it blocks video calls as well, and my partner stopped receiving the password to disable so I can no longer take video calls from Google Duo when needed. Please fix!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.everaccountable.bulldog","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.everaccountable.bulldog&hl=en&gl=au"}
