Blocks YouTube ads pretty well but also blocks everything else including my microphone when I try to type/search by voice. Totally locked up my phone and would not allow me to access my own Wi-Fi. This is Junk. If there was a no-star option I would choose it.","I had a few pop ups...but mostly crappy viewing of You Tube...WAIT...SINCE SPRINT MERGED WITH T-MOBILE...THAT HAS TOTALLY BLOWN MY PHONE SERVICE APART!!! I AM TOO HONEST...I JUST UNINSTALLED THIS TO TEST...BE BACK AFTER INVESTIGATION...","Does exactly what it says, sometimes. Sometimes you have to re-enable the app, other times you have to restart your device to get it to work. Speaking of, requires you to disable power saving mode to get it to work. To uninstall it, requires a 17 step process, as the Uninstall options are greyed out in App settings. There really shouldn't be this much B'S to use an app. I'll live with the ads until they fix the above issues.","It forced me to download a second browser although it actually works on chrome. The bad thing about it is that it filters any image in all websites in chrome, so you can not browse at all. I only wanted to filter YouTube ads which this app states in the description that it does filter... But that is not true. So three stars for forcing the download of extra apps, two for filtering so much that it's not even usable and one for just stating lies on the description. Don't install or download this."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.seven.adclear.fsb","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seven.adclear.fsb&hl=en&gl=au"}
