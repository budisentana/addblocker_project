The trial ran out and I decided it would be worth the $2 to keep the app, but after paying the app still said my trial was expired and never worked. Got Google to refund me. The developer should make a separate premium version with no restrictions since they can't figure out IAP's.","it's a really good and useful app, works perfectly without issues although minimizing the video while an ad is playing does glitch the audio a bit and if you unsubscribe from a channel with this app on it will undo it, other than that it's a really good and useful app I would happily recommend to anybody","Worked great while using it on the free trial. Had issues after buying, reinstalling fixed it for about an hour. Once again doesn't work. I use a Nokia C5 Endie.","Best ,dont make it paid version please,yet free this is the best one,super","Bug has not been fixed. I payed my $0.99 but it still says my trial period is over. The part that messes with me is it attempts to have me purchase access again."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"bg.alexxx.playtubeapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bg.alexxx.playtubeapp&hl=en&gl=au"}
