When it's off, I get a ton of ads. With it, almost none. I just bought it and now it turns on automatically after a reboot.","I don't know if I just don't know how to properly use this or what, but this app makes everything load incredibly slowly or not at all. I sometimes have to turn off the blocker, especially on Twitter, to make pages load, which makes ads pop up, defeating the purpose of this tool. And when it's on, sometimes ads pop up anyway. When it works and all pages load fine, it's great. But those times are rare.","When I tried the free version it worked pretty well. So I upgraded to the paid version. It stopped working even after setting it to stay open. I sent a message to the development team but got no answer. Samsung Note 10+ 5G,Android 11","App is pretty much false advertising and would not get it. It does not block 95% of the ads in chrome. It even blocked me from using chrome itself and kept saying I was offline. After disabling it I was a le to use it again. I do not recommend this at all. I even gave them 2 bucks which I'll never see again. So save your money and look for something that actually works and does not lie to you.","Wow!!ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© my phone's old and prone to viruses and I've had lots of popups recently, I don't know where. So I had enough and got this and wow!! As I type this it's already blocked 2k and I had it less then 10mins. I can finally surf the web without being bombarded with popups with me and my weak slow device ðŸ˜… thank you guys so much!! -UniBattles"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.spaceship.netprotect","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spaceship.netprotect&hl=en&gl=au"}
