When ever it's on , it's smooth sailing and it has so many filters and adjustments , so I know it has what you need . They have out- done themselves on this app. Shout out to the Developer on this one.","Ads still come through and is not user friendly. Have never gotten it to work, but now have to pay for it. DO NOT PURCHASE. NOT WORTH IT.","Is NOT free. Will NOT cancel no matter how many times you request that it STOP!!! Another disgusting deceptive \"service\" offered in the sea of internet sharks. BEWARE SHOPPERS!!!","Works for awhile and then lets some ads thru. Also got a warning that this app is using too much battery. Think it's doing some questionable stuff in the background. Will prob try other adblockers.","Literally every ad came through, I had to check on multiple occasions if it was on and it was, but ads would still be rampant."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rocketshipapps.adblockfast","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rocketshipapps.adblockfast&hl=en&gl=au"}
