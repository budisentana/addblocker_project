It has the same UI as classic chrome. And it definitely does what it says it does. ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ Full transparency: I've only seen one site so far that didn't have its ads blocked. I really don't need to go there tho as it has a mirror site without ads. ðŸ˜Š","Never had a problem and the only way to watch YouTube on mobile without ads. However, would be nice if YT would go full screen or fill the screen without having to select it for every video. What I mean is that when I rotate my screen to go landscape, YT is just too big and I have to manually resize using the \"full screen\" option within the YT view window. Not to bothered, though, coz not having ads makes up for it. This is an app I'd like to pay for, but can't. Use it on my PC, too. Brilliant.","After the latest update the layout is no longer the best, it's clear that the developers have copied computer layout and not taken into account that this is a phone browser, they now moved the quick menu line to the top instead of the bottom where it was easy to reach. On phones with big screens you can't reach the top without using two hands so it's no longer useful for one hand use. Please move the menu back or give an option at least.","EDIT for 2/20/21 update: I'm docking two stars from my original review. This update changed the location of the navigation options from the bottom of the screen to the top. I literally almost always use my phone with one hand, and now the new location of the tab change button makes this impossible. It's a shame because it's still my favorite browser by a country mile, I just have to use two hands to switch tabs now."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.adblockplus.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adblockplus.browser&hl=en&gl=au"}
