{"title":"Mutify - Mute annoying ads","description":"Mutify is the best Spotify ad silencing app you can get. That is completely free and works in the background.\n\nWhenever Mutify detects an ad is playing on Spotify, it helps you turn down the volume of the ads automatically, so that you can sit back and enjoy listening to your favorite music without worrying about those annoyingly loud ads.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n• You MUST enable 'Device Broadcast Status' in Spotify settings for Mutify to work. \n• Please add Mutify to battery saving exceptions list to make sure it works uninterruptedly in the background (optional) \n\nFEATURES:\n★ Simple and Clean User interface app while respecting user's privacy. <3\n★ Lets you hear ads at reduced volume instead of complete silence.\n★ Auto-mute ads when changing tracks using in-app media controls. \n★ Quick-setting tile to quick-launch Mutify from status bar.\n★ Ability to launch Spotify automatically.\n★ Consumes minimal battery.\n★ Light & Dark mode UI.\n★ Manual mute/unmute buttons.\n★ Control the media without leaving the app.\n★ And last but not least - an actual permission-free app!!\n\nNote: Mutify is NOT an ad blocker; it just helps you lower the device's volume whenever an ad is detected playing. So, it does not interfere with your Spotify app or asks for any unnecessary permissions to work.\n\n• Spotify Lite is NOT supported! It does not have the ‘Device Broadcast Status’ feature to work with Mutify. \n• Mutify does NOT support casting devices, because there's no way it can control volume for those devices! However, if your casting device supports pairing via Bluetooth, Mutify should work for you! \n\n  Developer Note - Mutify is developed and maintained by an individual dev, totally free of cost. Needless to say, I work on it part-time only. So please don’t send any unnecessary feature requests that don't entertain the app’s core functionality. Being a Spotify fan myself, I genuinely believe that this app will improve the music listening experience for those who cannot afford Spotify premium at the moment. However, if you want to enjoy the music listening experience to the fullest - I would highly recommend getting yourself a Spotify premium subscription. Believe me, It’s totally worth it!\nThank you & Happy Listening! :)\n- Teekam \n\nThanks for downloading Mutify.
