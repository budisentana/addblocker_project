{"title":"DuckDuckGo Private Browser","description":"The DuckDuckGo app provides the most comprehensive online privacy protection with the push of a button. With one free download, you get an everyday private Internet browser that offers seamless protection while you search and browse, and access to tracking protection for emails you receive and apps you use. Many of these protections are not offered in most popular web browsers by default.\n \nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\nSearch Privately by Default DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n \nBlock Tracking Cookies While Browsing Prevent most 3rd-party Internet cookies from tracking you as you browse online.\n \nEscape Website Trackers Before They Load Automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using any personal data from these trackers. Stay secure with our cutting-edge tracker-blocking technology – 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection, which goes above and beyond what you get in most popular web browsers by default.\n \nAutomatically Enforce Encryption\nForce many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider.\n \nBlock Email Trackers (Beta)\nOver 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses (@duck.com) contain trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n \nProtect Your Privacy in Other Apps (Beta)\nBlock most hidden app trackers in other apps day or night, and prevent third-party companies from invading your privacy with App Tracking Protection. This feature uses a VPN connection, but is not a VPN. It works locally on your device and does not collect personal data.\n \nEscape Fingerprinting\nHelp stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your web browser and device settings.\n \nBlock Tracking Cookies\nPrevent most third-party cookies from tracking you as you browse online from website to website.\n \nWe feature many protections not available on most Internet browsers (even incognito browsers), including protection from link tracking, Google AMP tracking, and more.\n \nEVERYDAY PRIVACY CONTROLS\nTap Fire Button, Burn Data\nClear your tabs and browsing data fast with our Fire Button.\n \nSignal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC)\nBuilt in to our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n \nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n \nRead more about this and our free Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections","descriptionHTML":"The DuckDuckGo app provides the most comprehensive online privacy protection with the push of a button.
