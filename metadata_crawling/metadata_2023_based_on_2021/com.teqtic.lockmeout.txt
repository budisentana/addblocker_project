It was originally released in 2014 and continues to improve with new features based on user feedback and requests.\n \nCustomer service is a top priority at TEQTIC. If you need help, please use the \"Contact Support\" menu option inside the app or email lockmeout@teqtic.com! We strive to respond to all emails as quickly as possible.\n \nInstall now and reclaim your precious time, free of distractions!\nDetailed Overview\nApp Blocking Modes\nThere are three app blocking modes. The first mode blocks the chosen apps and allows the rest. The second mode allows the chosen apps and blocks the rest. The third and strictest mode only allows use of the lock-screen. You can still answer calls or call emergency numbers in this mode.\n \nWebsite Blocking Modes\nThere are two website blocking modes. The first mode blocks the chosen URLs or URL keywords and allows the rest. The second mode allows the chosen URLs or URL keywords and blocks the rest.\n  \nUsage Based Lockouts\nUsage based lockouts have rules that trigger automatic lockouts based on your device usage. You can set up usage rules based on time spent in chosen apps, total screen time, the number of times apps are opened, or the number of device unlocks. Usage rules are scheduled to be enforced at the chosen times.\n \nScheduled Lockouts\nScheduled lockouts occur at the chosen times regardless of usage.\n \nLockout Options\nEach lockout has its own configurable options:\n• Unlock periodically with regular breaks (pomodoro)\n• Hide notifications from blocked apps\n• Turn on Do Not Disturb (DND)\n• Silence the ringer\n• Only lock at chosen physical locations\n• Allow a chosen payment to end the lockout early\n \nReducing notifications is important to help us eliminate frequent interruptions, which is vital for our focus, productivity, and mental health. Having lockouts limited to specific physical locations can improve focus while at school, the gym, or anywhere else apps can be a distraction. Less time spent on your phone at night can also improve your sleep.\n \nPremium Version\nThe premium version allows an unlimited number of lockouts, apps, websites, and locations. It allows enabling the option to prevent uninstallation and tampering. It also allows disabling the option to pay to end lockouts early or to reset passwords. Please consider upgrading to support future development! We want everyone to conquer their addiction. If you cannot afford the premium version, please email us.\n \nSensitive Permissions\nThe Accessibility Service permission is required to detect which apps or websites are open, so that your chosen apps and websites can be blocked. Information provided by the Accessibility Service is not collected or shared in any way.","descriptionHTML":"<h4><b>Can&#39;t put your phone down? Are you addicted to certain apps?
