Sorry for the inconvenience, I couldn't yet find a reliable method to restart the app in background when Android randomly kills it.\n\nOpen-source, 100% free Android App that skips Video Ads (does NOT block them).\n\nNever worry about clicking \"Skip Button\" to skip annoying ads again! This app does it for you :)\n\nAd Skipper does three things when you are watching your videos on YouTube:\n- Waits for Video Ads to appear;\n- When Video Ad appears, it mutes the media volume;\n- If the ad has the \"Skip Ad\" option after 5 seconds, the app clicks the \"Skip Ad\" button as soon as it appears and unmutes the media volume.\n\nAd Skipper acts as an Accessibility Service, so after installing it, you need to open the app and enable it manually, as Accessibility services have elevated permissions on your device and can read and interact with all the device's screen.\n\nHowever, Ad Skipper only acts on the video app's screen.
