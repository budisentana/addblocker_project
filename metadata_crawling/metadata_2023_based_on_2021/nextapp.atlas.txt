{"title":"Atlas Web Browser","description":"Atlas is a web browser that lets you take total control of your mobile web browsing experience:\n\n* Use AdBlockPlus (EasyList) filters to remove web annoyances, advertising, and tracking.  Filtering reduces data usage and dramatically improves performance and battery life when browsing.\n\n* Use the “Control Panel” slide-out to control site behavior: quickly toggle between desktop and mobile views.  Switch between \"HI-FI\" (full) and \"LO-FI\" (JavaScript-free) browsing experiences.\n\n* Optional Plus add-on lets you save content filtering, experience, desktop/mobile settings and more on a per-website basis.\n\n* Free, Ad-free, and Invasion-of-privacy-free: NextApp will make money only on the *optional* paid add-on.  Atlas DOES NOT collect information on your browsing habits or attempt to direct you to partner sites.  \n\n* Material Design-based user interface.\n\nBy removing undesired content and letting you take complete control over your web experience, Atlas uses less data, lowering CPU usage and preserving battery life.  Sites load more quickly as large amounts of often poorly-written and inefficient JavaScript code related to advertising and tracking can be discarded.\n\nAdditional features:\n\n* Dual-view mode (with paid Atlas+ add-on) adds the ability to view two sites at once.\n* Content-centric UI: No UI is visible when browsing, all available screen is used for displaying site content.\n\nPrivacy features:\n\n* Sandboxed Private Browsing: Private browsing runs in a separate process without any access to your cookies.  This prevents the cookie leakage into private sessions that is common among other third-party browsers under Android KitKat.\n* Automatic search and suggestions from the location bar can be disabled (or only enabled when you preface a query with a slash (“/”).\n\nAtlas follows NextApp's standard free/paid model: a well-featured and ad-free free version with an optional paid add-on that offers more capabilities.
