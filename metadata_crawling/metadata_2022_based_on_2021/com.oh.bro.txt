Gesture shortcuts, customization, perfected UI. Just an all around amazing app.","If I'm honest the browser is very good and super fast. The gestures are very convenient. But there is room for improvements. The ad blocker needs work, pop ups and ads are still there. It only blocks like half of ads and pop ups. Dark mode needs to be mor customizable, some images are too dark, we should get an option to disable that. Also video seems slow when loading and is choppy at the beginning compared to other browsers. If this is fixed then it'll be a perfect browser!","The combo of customization and privacy features is amazing. I love the gestures on the buttons. I think I've tried every browser on Android but I keep coming back. One feature I'd really like to see is a quick download in background that doesn't require a long press and three clicks üòÅ Edit: Aug 6 update seems to have broken the option to open links in another/default app. E.g. click a YouTube link opens the app. Can't seem to change it back! Still the best browser tho!","I really want to like this browser, but it fails at some very basic things. Opening new links when you have multiple tabs open does not open the new link up front; it actually puts the new tab at the back of the list. It also nags me to purchase the Full Version unlock every time I open a link, even though I already have. It was only $1.50 so I won't feel bad uninstalling it.","It is a blazingly fast and light browser from my limited play so far and I look forward to getting more used to the gestures. They seem like they could become intuitive. I'm a bit frustrated with the bookmarks (I cannot figure out how to move them into folders... How is this difficult?) and fiercely wish there was tab grouping."],"appId":"com.oh.bro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oh.bro&hl=en&gl=us"}
