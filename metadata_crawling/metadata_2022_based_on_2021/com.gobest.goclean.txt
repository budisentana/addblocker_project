I'm so pleased with the performance of this application. It is easy to use and works GREAT!!! In only a few minutes I was able to fix the issues on my phone and it works PERFECTLY. I was worried that I would have to reset my phone to factory settings because the adverts were ridiculously intrusive and were driving me bonkers. Thank you so much for Goclean. I'll be sure to recommend it to others. :)","After installing several different airpush detectors, I finally found go clean. Around 30 seconds after downloading the app, an ad popped up and go clean was able to figure out the program/app last opened and I was able to delete the PDF viewer that was pushing the ads! It had been about 24 hours and I havent had any airpush ads! Thank you so much!","I am not sure about this but I don't like it. It DOES pick up adds..but a lot of games have in game ads that are being detected. Those in game ads aren't causing this random advertisement to pop up on my home screen. I'm trying to detect this and I still can't find the issue because of detects too much. Thanks for the reply, ill give this a try. I upped your rating for a nice response.","I was getting random pop up ads for the past 2 weeks. Tried numerous suggestions and several other adware, malware & anti-virus apps. None could find the cause or what app was running when the ads popped up. Some would say Chrome was the cause, but something was telling Chrome to run the ads. Within 5 mins of installing this app I was able to see under the Ad Detector tab what app was the problem (APKExtractor Lite, had it on my phone for over a year). Thank you very much for this app!!!","A few weeks ago, I started getting full screen popup ads out of nowhere on my phone. I deleted all my most recent apps, cleared my browser history, ran malware checks---nothing fixed it. Then I tried Goclean. Within half an hour, my phone threw up an ad. I went to Goclean's history page and found the most recent app was a PDF viewer that I had not even opened. I deleted that app and have not had an ad since. I would never have suspected it without Goclean since I'd had it for weeks. Thanks!!"],"appId":"com.gobest.goclean","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gobest.goclean&hl=en&gl=us"}
