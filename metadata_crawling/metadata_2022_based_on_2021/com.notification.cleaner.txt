I do not reccomend.","I don't know a single phone that does not already come with this feature in a more convenient layout. I downloaded this in hopes that it would block spam texts and calls. Nope. Just blocks app notifications, which every phone can already do without some outside app. Also, why do you need my location? What even is this useless app and why so many good reviews???? It's a literal waste of space!","This app is AMAZING. I was so stressed with all the spam and unwanted notifications on my phone all of a sudden. I contacted Google and asked how to get rid of these unwanted notifications. They told me how and later send this app and told me to download from the app store. What a blessing. Right away it solved my problems. THANKS YOU SOOOO MUCH. GOD BLESS.","it failed to block a malware infected system app Android/PUP.Risktool.Agent.ay it has something to do with \"Software Update\" (version 2.04.13) and com.Redbend.dmClient. i get PUPs/Popups that have “Unfortunately, the process com.Android.phone has stopped\". weird while writting this the PUPs/Popups stopped. it's as if a hacker was watching me type this. turning the Tablet on & off seems to activate the pop ups/PUPs. it's very weird."],"appId":"com.notification.cleaner","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notification.cleaner&hl=en&gl=us"}
