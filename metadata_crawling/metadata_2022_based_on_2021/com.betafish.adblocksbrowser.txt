Did you change the whitelist to a blacklist that allows all the other damn sites to throw out pop ups that are constantly covering content and making the browser next to unusable? ETA: I see that many users are complaining about the app's performance with YouTube specifically. But I find it doesn't work anywhere. I'm not against ads. Content providers need money to operate, and I understand that. Bit the constant pop ups over half the screen are too much.","Been using it for years on desktop, mobile has always been iffy but recently its flat out stopped working. I always block ads on youtube because I watch videos to help me sleep and the ads at the end wake me back up again, it was driving me crazy. Desktop version I have nothing but good things to say but the mobile has always been pretty poor and has stopped working altogether, even fully updated. Please fix it.","So disappointed, The original AdBlock for my android started acting up. Freezing without showing my complete Youtube page, I tried everything but it wouldn't work any more. Deleted the app to get a fresh download but the only thing available was this version for Samsung. It doesn't work.","I installed adblock on my android device and it worked for a short time. Then it locked on the features page page and I cannot get it to start. I uninstalled and reinstalled twire installed twice and got the very same results.","The first youtube video I watched after installing played 2 unskipable adds at the beginning. I was using youtube through Samsung Internet I was NOT using the YouTube app. Don't bother downloading this app it does not work."],"appId":"com.betafish.adblocksbrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betafish.adblocksbrowser&hl=en&gl=us"}
