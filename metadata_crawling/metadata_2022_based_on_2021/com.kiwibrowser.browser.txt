Unlike with classic browsers in get the results I've been trying to find quickly. It also appears to be quite a bit slower, and crashes once in a while. All negative points aside this is a great browsing app with lots more options you'd get on classic, standard browser.This has alot more potential then what I'm perceiving.","Without a doubt, currently the best browser available on Android. Between its focus on privacy, customization, and wide-ranging extension support, Kiwi Browser is peerless. However, where it needs improvement is with customer support and fixing known issues/problems. Scrolling through the reviews you will notice several mentioned problems that have gone unresolved for a year or more. I've had the same experience. Unfortunately, customer service does not seem to be a top priority at the moment.","Overall it's a really great concept: Mobile browser with desktop extensions. But I had a couple of issues. 1. The browser seems to have really slow internet connection? When I search with Brave browser, everything is very quick. But on Kiwi images take forever to load and videos on YouTube buffer constantly. 2. I couldn't find a way to add Brave search as a search engine. 3. I would like an option in the settings to autodelete browsing data on browser exit, with cookie exceptions.","Best chrome based browser for Android..period! Biggest advantage is being able to use the desktop extensions on a mobile device. Edit: 04/23/2022 Version 101.0.4951.40 keeps on crashing in 3 seconds after launch, tried clearing cache and unimportant data but no fix. If developers can add a feature to backup extensions that would make life a lot easier for users.","Best browser Bar None. Among the tons of features this speedy champ has, my favorite has to be its dark mode. I don't know how its developers pulled it off, but no addon on any other browser I searched for far manages to do such a great job with flipping the colors. Also, pictures are not flipped, something so hard to achieve."],"appId":"com.kiwibrowser.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
