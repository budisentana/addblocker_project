It takes me way slower to switch tabs and freezes. Another major problem is that when i leave the app, instead of immediately erasing all data and making it so that nothing happened, i can easily go back into the app as if i never left. Otherwise, decent app.","Incognito always loyal, discreet quiet efficient, plus a great advisor, the top of the top, la creme de la creme, never been desapointed thanks to the team for their great job keep it up as Long it's possible we all appreciate Gday 2 you","Good app for downloading files in full speed like uc browser gives but some files downloading half then i pause then i close the browser again open then i not found the pause download file.","The annyoing thing is when you use your 'back' or 'return' button, it doesn't simply undo your action but undoes your last search. On google it would have worked. So that's a bit of a shame","It is the best server, for research and for it simplicity to use."],"appId":"com.androidbull.incognito.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidbull.incognito.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
