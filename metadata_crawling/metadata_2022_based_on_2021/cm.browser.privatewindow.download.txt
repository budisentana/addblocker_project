Ads covers browser plus you cannot navigate. No way to open a new tab. No buttons visible for opening another tab except for the first you opened upon launching the app. Perhaps, the permanent ads bar on the top of the browser makes menu inaccessible. No menu from which to block ads. Horrible is my feelings about this browser.","Sorry, I'm not going to be bombarded by ads that pop-up every time I either switch tabs in the browser or opened the browser, I don't mind if I have an ad that cover the bottom or just the top so I deleting it.","Total poop, if anyone can see this don't get this confused with \"Cheetah Browser\" like I did! Idk what this is but I can tell ya it's hot garbage just type in Cheetah Browser instead you'll thank me! Update this app is supposed to be a downloader I guess? But I didn't see anything in it for any hint of a downloader and it would be brought up as an option to use for a browser when trying to open links. Also whatever ad blocker it supposedly has is non functional, like at all.","I like the layout of the old App. I got a new phone and had to download the app. Too busy looking. I'm ADHD and I need something basic like before. I like the ability to clear out history and such, or bookmark on the old app. This new one is way too busy, and too many ads. I may delete it.","It's okay, but a little restricted in terms of a browser. Can't enter a url, only search. And there's no settings menu for anything. It's definitely not like the original CM Browser which was taken off the market for some reason. Glad i kept that installed."],"appId":"cm.browser.privatewindow.download","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cm.browser.privatewindow.download&hl=en&gl=us"}
