Fix bugs that log-in sometimes doesn&#39;t work.<br>2. Several other bug fixes.","comments":["This browser is OK, I had too many issues with it to rate it higher. First off, on my tablet (hp 7, running android 4.1.2) it doesn't work and just gives me an error message saying \"This version of UC Turbo you installed is not compatible with your phone\". Second, the ad blocker doesn't work very well at all, I think I only saw a few pages where the ads were actually blocked. Third, it's not as fast as other browsers I've used and there were some websites that didn't work because they think the browser is outdated. I would have given this browser two stars but I like the fact that you can watch videos in high resolutions while saving bandwidth, on one of my devices, I'm able to watch videos in resolutions much higher than what other browsers are capable of on that device.","New- The app is crashing the moment a page is created. Old- It's a really good browser, but, excluding video player format which is great, I wish it was more alike to the original UC Broswer, especially the tab retention. With or without incognito mode active, device shut down/restart, connecting with Bluetooth, the tabs would stay until they were closed.","This actually suprised me how clean it looked and felt compared to every other browser I've tried ever since I gave up on chrome, although a few things stuck out. With the night mode it dims the content instead of using just the dark theme. I don't need the content to be dimmed I already have a scheduled screen dimmer. It'd be pretty nice if I had a choice. Secondly being able to change the position of the open tab(s) in the tab menu would be very helpful. I hope this isn't too much to ask for.","one of the best browsers out there but there are some things that could be improved. 1: it would be nice if the toolbar completely disappeared instead of a white line at the bottom 2: it would be nice to have an easier layout of the tabs page, maybe something like Samsung's or Apple's? 3: I love dark mode but not night mode, it would be nice if you had a dark mode that didn't dim everything, and if they really wanted night mode there would be a bar to adjust the brightness of dark mode","Best browser. The good: Quick, reliable, useful data saving options. Secure and extremely stable. The (kinda) bad: swipe forward/backward gestures are too sensitive, too easy to accidentally trigger a gesture, especially while watching a video. An option to change sensitivity of the gestures, or make them less sensitive in general.. be awesome! Second, native video player is lacking in features, especially skip ahead. Please please add that feature! Or make native slider global. Thanks!"],"appId":"com.ucturbo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ucturbo&hl=en&gl=us"}
