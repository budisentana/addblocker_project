Yes, you can easily control what you see or dont see, but it constantly force closed itself. Thay wouldnt be such a big deal, but even with it set to 'restore previous session' it would just bring up the home page when re-opened. I paid for this and regret it. Im back on Google Chrome.","I've tried almost all the applications about parental controlling and safe browsing on the web . from \"Kaspersky\" and \"Webguard\" to \"Nod32\" and \"Bitdiffender \"but none of them is even close to what this application does . Its simple , effective and runs smoothly . I also created my own blacklist and added different URLs which i couldn't do in other apps because they just block domains not URLs .and developer was so helpful about a question i asked .I recommend it to all who care about their kids","This is great and I am going to stick with it. One change That I would love to see would be a more efficient way to add sites to the whitelist. It would be great if when I'm signed in (parent) then i could just do a search in the browser and then just click on sites to add. anyway, I like your app so keep developing.","Was really difficult to get going...lots of troubleshooting on different devices, support was helpful. Doesn't seem to update shortcuts to white listed sites into the associated parental control app...it seems like it would be exactly what I'm looking for if the software actually acted the way I would expect it to...soooo much trouble."],"appId":"com.kiddoware.kidsafebrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiddoware.kidsafebrowser&hl=en&gl=us"}
