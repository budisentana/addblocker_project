The new look is a visual statement of our commitment to climate action being stronger than ever. We hope you like it! ","comments":["i used to love ecosia and recommend it to everyone but lately it's been a little frustrating. like many others i wish there was an option to turn off the grid view for tabs, and additionally i cannot stand the automatic tab grouping. i love the option of ad blocking....except it doesn't work. i still get ads all the time where there shouldn't be. i feel like ecosia used to be perfect or damn near it, but now it's been changed too much and for the worse.","I've used Ecosia for 2+ years. I love the work they are doing to address climate change and deforestation. The built-in ad blocker and option to reject cookies was helpful. Their search engine is less robust and the browser is unusable for local results, but workable. The June update, however, is atrocious. The aesthetics are visually repelling. The ad blocker is defunct as ads pop up like crazy and are also the first 10 results returned on search. The browser now also lags interminably. Fix!","I'm incredibly disappointed the this browser had now switched to the grid view for tabs. It's hard to use for me and the lack of it is one reason I was using this app in the first place. I hope that you all make it an optional feature because I will mostly likely have to find a new browser if it stays. Edit: I did switch because I couldn't stand the thumbnail layout anymore and it didn't seem to be changing. I'm severely disappointed.","I love the app, however the new update that changed the layout of multiple tabs from a flip-through list to a bunch of thumbnails is absolutely terrible. Please revert this change, or at least add an option so that we can go back to the old style. As someone who regularly has 100+ tabs open at any time, this change might force me to find a new browser, which I really don't want to have to do.","This app is fast. It has a solid ad blocker too, but it also has a few really annoying interface features. - It seems like every browser is adopting this grid layout for multiple tabs, and I hate it. - Ecosia also asks me to allow cookies every single time it opens, makes me change my search settings every time it opens, and shows Google results in light mode even though I have dark turned on."],"appId":"com.ecosia.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ecosia.android&hl=en&gl=us"}
