A good alternative that works just as responsive only it does not integrate as well with android services. Which kind of is it's biggest downside, but that I more of android and Google's fault than it is adblock browser's fault. So it's annoying it doesn't run on top of chrome like it does on a desktop environment, which makes having the features easy. But with a slight behavior change using this browser instead of chrome or the search bar is all it takes üëç","Aside from blocking annoying ads, the biggest reason I use this is to prevent mobile sites from needlessly consuming bandwidth (and costing me money)! This browser seems to have no way to tell it to never automatically download/play video content. Certain sites, like yahoo, love to play video at you that isn't an ad but I don't want to watch, especially when I'm on 4g in some waiting room... Otherwise... it does seem to do a pretty good job of blocking ads, mostly, though some do get through.","If you're familiar with the AdBlock web extension on yourr computer, this app is the mobile version. It's simple and easy browser with built-in ads and pop-up blocking features. It's built on the same platform as chrome so it won't look too unfamiliar, but when you figure how it works you'll love it's features.","I can say AdBlock Browser has improved and mostly works well now. It was less resource hungry compared to Firefox on my old phone (with a mediocre processor and small amount of memory), and it runs great on the new phone. However, the app still lacks a way to stop video content autoplay, which is really annoying. As soon I come across an embedded video, it plays automatically whether I want it or not. Like I said, there's no way to stop this, and that's a huge oversight.","It's 2022 and this browser still doesn't have an export or sync function, so there isn't any way to backup or transfer the bookmarks. Displays a blank screen on YT videos and makes you wait for the \"skip ad\" button before you can start the video. This app no longer gets updated and appears to have been abandoned by the developers. You can avoid ads and the aforementioned problems by using another browser and an adblocker add-on, such as Firefox for Android with the AdGuard AdBlocker add-on."],"appId":"org.adblockplus.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adblockplus.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
