Step 2 enable it in your Samsung internet that's it no need to open the app itself.","Not effective.. There are ads on YouTube videos.","whats going on? making this app active prevents me from accessing google play. I have to disable the app in order to bring up anything in google play. It also doesn't block ads. Whatever changes made were not for the better.","Safest ad & malware blocker for my Yandex browser I also use it on my other phone ad clear has out performed all others like rocket etc I been using it for 1 year n will continue to use & support it. Thanks Dev üôèüôè","It forced me to download a second browser although it actually works on chrome. The bad thing about it is that it filters any image in all websites in chrome, so you can not browse at all. I only wanted to filter YouTube ads which this app states in the description that it does filter... But that is not true. So three stars for forcing the download of extra apps, two for filtering so much that it's not even usable and one for just stating lies on the description. Don't install or download this."],"appId":"com.seven.adclear.fsb","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seven.adclear.fsb&hl=en&gl=us"}
