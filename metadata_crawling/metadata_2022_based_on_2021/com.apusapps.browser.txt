There used to be minor ads that would appear down at the bottom, which is perfectly fine. But now there are full on pop-up ads that show up at least every five seconds. There also seems to be a bug where the buttons(?) at the bottom disappear, which forces me to close the app and reopen it, then they disappear again at some point anyway. Had a good run with this app, but I think it's time to find a new browser.","Browser was fantastic and easy to use but there's one problem. If unwanted pop up ad open there's no way to get back website this problem make me so uncomfortable. please improve ad blocker like brave browser ad blocker was perfect. By the way apus browser was great. if ad blocker problem solved. so this improve make this browser great to perfect","Hey, i think you should visit ( BrowserGood. Com ) to download and install browser good app. It's the best browser around right now. It uses the Chromium engine (which powers Google Chrome) with built in privacy features. It is also getting better with every update and allows syncing bookmarks across your devices through anonymized connections rather than setting up a user profile. They also added a cryptocurrency wallet to the desktop version, so my guess is they will port it to mobile soon.","I wanted to download a vid which this did (it was slow as hell, but it worked) but no matter how many times I disable the unwanted features like weather reports from places ive never been or will never go and the screen saver that locks your phone randomly whilst playing apps or making calls they turn themselves back on, meaning this app seems to have more control over MY device than me!! Avoid! Theres far less invasive apps that can download...","You should visit ( BrowserGood. Com ) to download and install the browser app. It not ads and very fast. Apus! Did seem fast, i'll give it that, but i clicked on maybe 4 pages on a site i know very well does not, never has, and never will use ads and Asus popped up an ad on every page. Chrome, Firefox, Yandex, Ecosia, Dolphin, Opera, Maxthon, none of them ever managed to get an ad or pop-up on that site, Asus 4 in less than 5 minutes."],"appId":"com.apusapps.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apusapps.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
