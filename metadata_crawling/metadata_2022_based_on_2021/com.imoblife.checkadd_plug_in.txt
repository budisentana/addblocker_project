Naturally, I've installed the plugins. I see a few reviews stating that this plug-in works. Disappointed -- NOT on my nearly new LG V30 phone. A couple weeks ago, i started getting obnoxious splash screen junk ads. SEVERAL of them repeating, every session on my device. Two (2) of them are even piled atop one another, when i power up my phone. This plugin pops up on my screen, but hasn't helped a bit, STOPPING ALL OF THE ADS!","For those that gave this 1 star, please read the app infornation first before mindlessly installing. This is a 'plug-in' NOT designed as a stand-alone application, it needs 'All-in-One Toolbox' app to work, as stated in the description. Having said that, it works as designed, identifying apps with ads within them. Trouble is 99.9% of all FREE apps contain ads. Its the price you pay for free. So basically, I uninstalled because I would have to remove nearly all of my apps.","Adds more pop-up ads, rather than identifying anything. It will show you a list of installed apps that it thinks contain advertising, but will not identify the program that took over your phone with an ad. In fact, this app will guarantee a full screen pop-up every time you check your phone.","Doesn't do a damn thing. No option to open the app. Uninstalling this garbage. I don't want your \"All in one toolbox\" in order to make it work. I just want one functionality and it's to find the damn apps responible for ads on my phone. Nothing less or more.","This is a great app for free.... When you start to see pop ap adds in your phone and you don't know what app is causing it especially if you are downloading games through links in google chrome or other browser . Best to try this. My problem was solved.. Dont forget to install the All in one tool box otherwise it will not work..."],"appId":"com.imoblife.checkadd_plug_in","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imoblife.checkadd_plug_in&hl=en&gl=us"}
