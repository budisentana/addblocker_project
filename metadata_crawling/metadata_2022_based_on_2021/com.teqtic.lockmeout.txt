The blocked apps mode allows you to choose a list of apps you want blocked during the lockout. The allowed apps mode allows you to choose a list of apps you want to allow during the lockout. The most strict is the lock-screen only mode, which only allows use of the lock-screen. You can still answer calls or call emergency numbers in this mode. You may also choose websites to block or to allow.\n \nUsage based lockouts\nSet up rules that will trigger an automatic lockout based on your device usage. You can set up usage rules based on time spent in chosen apps, total screen time, the number of times apps are opened, or the number of device unlocks. Usage rules can be scheduled to only be enforced at chosen times.\n \nScheduled lockouts\nSet up lockouts that repeat regularly on a schedule. You can choose the start and end time, the days of the week, the lockout mode, and additional options for each scheduled lockout.\n \nLockout options\nEach lockout has its own configurable options:\n• Unlock periodically with regular built-in breaks (pomodoro)\n• Hide notifications from blocked apps\n• Turn on Do Not Disturb (DND)\n• Silence the ringer\n• Only activate at chosen physical locations\n• Allow a chosen payment to end the lockout early\n \nReducing notifications is important to help us eliminate frequent interruptions, which is vital for our focus, productivity, and mental health. Having lockouts limited to specific physical locations can improve focus while at school, the gym, or anywhere else apps can be a distraction. Less time spent on your phone at night can also improve your sleep.\n \nPremium version\nThe free version is limited to 3 lockouts, and lists of up to 10 apps or websites. The premium version has no limitations. Please consider upgrading to support future development! We want everyone to conquer their addiction. If you cannot afford the premium version, please email us.\n \nSensitive permissions\nThe Accessibility Service permission is required to detect which apps are open, so that your chosen apps can be blocked. It is also required to detect which website is open, so that your chosen websites can be blocked. Information provided by the Accessibility Service is not collected or shared in any way.","descriptionHTML":"<h4><b>Can&#39;t put your phone down? Are you addicted to your phone?

Love the customizability. Better than digital wellbeing which was too easy to get around \"just this once\". I have a bedtime lockout set and a 30 minute addictions timer. One thing I would love is a snooze, where it'll give you a warning before your time is up and you can add 5 minutes (one time!). Sometimes I'm in the middle of a chess game and it's like nope, you're done, all of a sudden. I'd like a chance to finish the game. Great app, thanks.","Nice work...I really like how hard / impossible it is to override with all the customization options. 1) The \"one time\" blockout time picker is weird. While I can select a specific start and end time fine - the fixed period (30 minutes...) seems cumbersome and does not function always (android) and 2) Biggest apprehension is the obvious permissions needed by the App. Do you document what is data is captured by you and / or on the device? How is it transmitted / protected / audited?","This is the first thing I download whenever I get a new phone. It's gotten almost impossible to live without a smartphone, but they can quickly take over your life. Lock Me Out makes it easy to keep using the apps you need while limiting the distractions. And I love being able to set up different blocks by location. This app has literally made my life better!","Honestly this is a solid app with solid development - you can tell it's been heavily tested! I am so impressed with the functionality it has. I've only had it for a few hours and I almost never review things this quickly. Highly recommend this to anyone trying to limit their usage. The $5 option to unlock it is genius cause I would never 😂 it's perfect for me to get my focus on for work without limiting my ability to contact people or do work related things.","After using Digital Detox on and off for 3 years, I switched over to Lock Me Out because I wanted to allow certain websites instead of blocking the whole browser. Despite the basic-looking UI, this app has more features than a lot of its competitors, and I appreciate how compactly the settings are organized. One feature I still wish for, which I haven't found in any competitors either, is being able to count some websites towards the usage limit but not others."],"appId":"com.teqtic.lockmeout","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teqtic.lockmeout&hl=en&gl=us"}
