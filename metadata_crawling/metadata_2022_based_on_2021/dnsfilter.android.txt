Some other DNS filters I've used work great, but occasionally ads do slip through with 'em. My only issue is that it tends to auto deactivate if not used for a while (probably battery conservation[?] 🤷‍♂️). But, it doesn't notify you, about it - though it will say it's deactivated if you scroll through silent notifications. Overall, great and effective app! 😙👌","This is a very good app, with flexible settings so you can tailor what gets blocked and what doesn't. So far I have not had any crash or network speed issues issues at all. The app will switch to dark/night mode automatically with your system. And yes it is an eye opener when you view the log and see all of the leaches. Block on!!","I genuinely love this experience, within five minutes of getting it, im no longer getting pop-up t-mobile reward ads when I try to do some work and play my favorite games, its working like a dream and I don't think I've had an ad blocker work this well! Five stars from me!","This is the the best ad blocker out there. This application has caused me no problems and it works 100% all the time. It perfectly gets rid of ads and doesn't lag or need up your phone at all. I would rate this more than five stars I could.","So simple! So effective! This ad blocker, because that is what it is, runs silently in the background and block unwanted sites and ads like no other. It's run by filters created for general ad blocking use but this app lays on top making it all easy. May look a little intimidating at first but just make sure it runs and the apk takes care of the rest. It runs on my phone 24/7/365 and blocks around 40% of what tried to enter my phone in form of trackers and ads. Make donation easier! 😎"],"appId":"dnsfilter.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dnsfilter.android&hl=en&gl=us"}
