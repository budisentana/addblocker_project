Not only did it stop these notifications, but my phone is 100 faster. The annoying pop ups would freeze my phone until I acknowledge the pop up by pressing okay or report. Excellent timely application, thank you for a solution that was about to make me throw the phone out the window. Now just as good as new. Thanks for a great app","Meh...it's an OK app. \"Set blocking hours\", I presume, means it is supposed to automatically start blocking & stop blocking at set times. It doesn't. You have to manually switch it on. It doesn't block system notifications either. Since it's a free app, I gave 3 stars. If I had paid for it, it would be 1 star. Bummer.","Beautiful, among the best. The features of this application makes for real fun. Compared to most I, ve used, this one is now my permanent notify this is why am not rating it a 5 star üåü but must recommend it to someone special to me. Thanks for the free version .Great works.","developers your app is still crashing after the last update what happened update developers app is working very good now compared to what it was a year ago it's blocking notifications like it supposed to and it hasn't crashed any more thanks again keep up the good work better than any notifications blocker I've ever tried üòùüëç","Was great but no longer works. It just exits suddenly all the time. Too bad."],"appId":"com.hanstudio.notifyblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hanstudio.notifyblocker&hl=en&gl=us"}
