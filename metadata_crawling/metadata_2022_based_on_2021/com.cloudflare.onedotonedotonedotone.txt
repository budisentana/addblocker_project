Also, it also unblocks some locally blocked websites, such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. Just one thing. Since it doesn't change the IP address, I don't think it's very safe to use in some countries where there's no freedom of speech. Otherwise, it just makes a good app.","My experience with 1.1.1.1 WARP is that it's a straight-forward secure DNS changer that does what it says on the tin smoothly and without any glitches. My personal preference for such an app would include a bit more (such as an app firewall), but in terms of doing what it was made for, this is a fiver.","It's alright. As far as I can find out, it prevents snooping, keeps no logs, allows individual applications to be excluded, but unfortunately shares IP with the website or service you are using. Also, I couldn't see a way to remove Photos and YouTube from exclusion list, which really should be a customer choice if for only the possibility that they didn't want backups or YouTube working. Call it a low tech hack to keep your kid who is using your phone safe.","It seems like ever since that major Cloudflare outage in June or July, this app works inconsistently. When it does work, it's great. However, I am finding myself constantly having to disable it to get my internet working again; which was never an issue prior to the outage. I've tried changing my connection between WiFi and cellular, and going into airplane mode; and the only two things that restores internet service is a phone reset or disabling this app. Its just not worth the continued hassle.","The VPN functionality is pretty good. Reasonable speeds when connected to a decent WiFi connection. However, over 4G it's super slow, half the apps and websites don't load content, as traffic gets blocked. Probably the most annoying thing about the app is the trusted network feature. It will pause when on the trusted network, but only the first time you add the network to the list. After that, you have to flip a coin, because ~50% of the time, it turns on when connected to your trusted networks."],"appId":"com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone&hl=en&gl=us"}
