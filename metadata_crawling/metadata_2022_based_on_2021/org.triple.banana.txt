Able to load pages fast and runs well. However, the ad blocker could use some improvements. Like when I watch YouTube videos, sometimes an ad will pop up. It does says \"skip\" right away. So I always have to click on the skip button when that happens. It would be very helpful if you could fix this issue.","Started playing youtube ads as soon as I signed in?? After logging back out it seems to have started blocking again so at least there's that Edit: nope. Every once in a while will play ads while logged out. This doesn't bode well... Further edit: ya it's getting worse. On some videos an ad will play without fail. Presumably the more \"ad friendly\" the video the more override power.","Love this app, just need to improve ad blocker a bit.. if it allows to add custom filters that will be great. Another requirement is chrome extension support.. i hope we will get this in future.","1. Hey pls add my favourite at homepage where i could edit them according to my need. 😥 2. Dark mode is little buggy with facebook. Check emoji react in post. They looks like ghost 👻 3. Most of the time Facebook not opening with mobile site mode but if i change it to desktop then it works. 🤤","The new pages don't automatically translate once you have translated the website. After every click you have to translate again and the translation tool can't be edited to toolbar."],"appId":"org.triple.banana","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.triple.banana&hl=en&gl=us"}
