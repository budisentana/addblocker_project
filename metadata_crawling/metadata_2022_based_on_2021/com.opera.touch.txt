This version includes latest bug fixes and improvements.","comments":["Beautiful, clean, simple, and fast... This is basically Chrome, but modernized, streamlined, and stripped of all the unnecessary garbage... The quick access button feature is absolutely SPECTACULAR! I had to deduct a star because as of this moment, (perhaps I haven't done enough exploring) auto-fill does not work in the browser... This is the best browser design I've experienced as of yet! Keep it up guys! ü§ô‚úåÔ∏è","The good: it's fast, has an appealing esthetic, and easy to navigate options within the browser settings. The con: there's no \"back\" button. When on a website and following a link within the site, one must reload the page to get back to main page or close the tab and start again. The Moto G doesn't have a back navigation button. Also, there's no means to add a favorites speed dial site. Only recently used are in the browser body. Overall I'd still recommend.","Excellent choice for a lightweight, fast browser. I like the shortcut button to get to the various tabs, search options. The tab feature should be restricted to the tabs that are opened in the current session only. However, I find the tab feature shows every page you've visited (at least from the last time you've cleared the settings). If this feature is for searching your browsing history, it should be renamed as such. The Flow option is also a great feature.","Really smooth, fast and easy to use. The Fast Action Button is a smart and unique feature. It makes one handed browsing a lot easier since you don't need to reach the top of the page to switch tabs, start a new search, or share the page you're currently on. The one feature I'd like to see is the ability to add your own search engine. I'd like to use Ecosia, but can only choose between the search engines already chosen for me. If this ever gets fixed, I'd definetly give 5 stars.","It's a wonderful browser, the ad-blocking is useful, the interface is nice and clean, and the F.A.B. makes navigation more intuitive than other mobile browsers. So all in all, there isn't anything wrong with it. Although an addition of a tab on the home screen for news with a \"Your Sources\" section would be great. Having that integrated into the desktop browser so I could get articles from sites that actually interested me personally was a huge draw for me to switch to Opera."],"appId":"com.opera.touch","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.touch&hl=en&gl=us"}
