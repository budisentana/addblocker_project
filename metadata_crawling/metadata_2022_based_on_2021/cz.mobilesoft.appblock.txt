I found a bug that I exploited but I feel guilty üòÇ so when you have picture-in-picture active (ex. YouTube) and have a time set for the app (1 hour per day) the time doesnt do the active countdown... Soo.... Timer went off when I was searching for a video, and then I was just watching YouTube. But honestly, when I locked myself out for a week out of all distractions I felt amazing. So much more focused and my anxiety levels reduced drastically.","Three pretty big drawbacks; everything else is great. (1) Since installing, my phone doesn't pair well with my car. I can't get audio over the car speaker system during calls or connect to my Google assistant. (2) I can't uninstall ANY other apps without punching in the code. (3) I couldn't block specific sites, I had to block the entire browser making it so I can't do ANYTHING on it. This is a bit annoying/inconvenient. Hopefully eventually both have a fix. Other than that it's been great. 4/5","I love everything about this app except for one fatal flaw, no password option, it locks with a 4-digit pin. I'd like to choose a complicated random password, That way I can write the password down and put it somewhere that's inconvenient enough to keep me from disabling the app in 10 seconds like I can with a pin. I'm no programmer, but I can't imagine this being a difficult feature to add. Add a password lock option, and this is a 5-star app for sure.","When it works, it works, and gotta admit this works very well. It's an easy to set up system that blocks the apps and sites you designate that automatically turns on and off according to your schedule. It does show the occasional ad when you get blocked during those off times, but you can immediately exit it, and all the more punishment for trying to procrastinate, right? But here I am procrastinating by writing this review, back to work!","Been having multiple glitches like locking sites when it should not. The countdowns aren't staying up-to-date and the only advice I got when I sent in an error report was to delete and recreate profiles. Well, I tried that and the problem migrated to different profiles. That continued. So I am trying a delete and start from scratch. I pay for this service and I'm pretty irritated that its basic functionality is failing."],"appId":"cz.mobilesoft.appblock","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.mobilesoft.appblock&hl=en&gl=us"}
