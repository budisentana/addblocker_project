I like the simplicity of the UI. I wish I could make the Bookmarks tab the homepage. One of the few browser that do have and EXIT button. Thank you!!! Moreover it does not beg you for a 5 star rating. There is not even a menu item to do that from the app. I gave the app 5 stars but I am finding that you cannot import bookmarks from a simple html file (pretty much all major browser have that option). A little disappointment, I hoped to use it as my default browser...PS 040719..This app is not updated and I am starting to get messages about it not being supported (ebay). The last update is from 2017. No reason to invest time and energy to this app anymore. 1 star","No option to delete browser history at once. No permanent incognito mode. The homepage was terrible but thankfully can be changed. Good part is that it has plenty of search engines by default. Still a long way to go to be the best browser.","It's a good browser, and it respects your privacy, but when you have too many tabs open at the same time, it slows way down. So just limit open tabs to 5 or something, and remember to close them when done.","Set Duckduckgo as search engine repeatedly, but it insists on using google. That alone is reason enough for me to uninstall, but the thing has so many ads, almost all of them foreign (east asian?), on the home page. Life is too short for this, and IDGAF about all that Indian stuff. Might be good for east asia, but not America.","Just can't believe of the speed till now I was using chrome and it gave me a download speed of 1mb or below but me gave me up to 7mb/s and average of 3mb in total its browsing is also good, I just tried for ads and yes it doesn't shows ads as Described. This browser is too good. I have just installed it, and am fan of it. Thanks for this App."],"appId":"com.mebrowser.webapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mebrowser.webapp&hl=en&gl=us"}
