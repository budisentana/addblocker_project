Not being able to switch the search engine is a major downside. Also, I don't want the buttons at the bottom. I don't download videos from websites and I don't need a \"soft button\" dedicated to YouTube. It does really well at loading pages, even ones that other major browsers have issues with but that itself isn't quite enough for me to make it default.","Overall a good browser, but a few annoying things that prevents me from using it on a daily basis. 1. No import of bookmarks from an html file. 2. Does have the reading mode, however, it rotates into the portrait mode, while I use the landscape mode on my 8 \"tablet. 3. Would like to see more customization, e.g. background, icons in the speed dial (they all show the mint donut), make a local page as the home page (e.g. bookmarks). The only option is a URL or 'default' but you can't change the 'default' and few other things.","Download speed is very slow, and download process cannot be paused. That is a big flaw for a browser. However, as this is first release I would like to wait for the next update. And interface is very attactive, browsing experience is very smooth. Deserve best wishes! Bug in Jan 9 Update: - still needs to sign in after every time I start the browser.","Wonderful browser. It's quick and snappy, has a clean and simple to use UI, and the only quam I've had is that it will only allow a max of 16 tabs to be open at any one time. This probably isn't a problem for most people but I am one of those chronic tab openers that will open 100s of tabs in a short time without noticing how many I've opened. Still give this 5 stars though because it's the fastest browser I've ever used and really has no major issues. Love it!","The best browser I've ever used. It's quick, easy and it allows you to immediately download some videos very fast. The only thing I don't like is if you close the app and reopen it, whatever page you were on will be gone. I've looked though the setting and couldn't find any options that would allow me to change it so I guess that's just how this app is"],"appId":"com.mi.globalbrowser.mini","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.globalbrowser.mini&hl=en&gl=us"}
