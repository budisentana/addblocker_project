our name to Orions Browser.","comments":["Trial-ing at this time. Downloaded the app yesterday and have been using it for several hours now. Impressions so far: Pluses app has potential. Nice feature set, easy to navigate and configure. Minuses, crashed several times already. Quite a few websites won't open citing SSL error, one of them being eBay. Sort these out and the Dev has a winner I think.","Pros: Lots of features, great user interface/customization. Cons: It's a bit slow sometimes when loading pages and the app crashes semi-frequently. Still, I like it enough to keep using it despite this, and Monument is a nice alternative to bigger browsers and comparable in terms of features. I hope the developers continue to improve their browser!","I use on Windows 10 for the split screen functionality.  A recent update removed the split screen option from the address bar when placed at top.  Please put it back.   I can't figure out why this was done.  Using the address bar at the bottom makes using multiple tabs much more cumbersome.   Again, please add the split screen button back to at least the menu for top loaded address bars.","This has many really great features not found in other browsers but the tab view constantly reorders tabs based on the one you last accessed which is incredibly annoying if you are dealing with lots of similar tabs from one site. It quickly becomes impossible to keep track of which tab is which. It's also pretty aggressive about discarding tab contents which breaks a lot of websites when you switch back and it has to reload. Granted, that is technically the web developer's fault not the browser's but it makes it hard for me to use this as my primary browser.","This is without a doubt the BEST browser for Android -hands down. I've tried (and bought) them ALL they're not even close don't waste your time. Great job Devs -I HIGHLY recommend. If you have the extra $2.99 to buy the ad free -DO IT!! No ads + extras are well worth it. I'd have gladly paid much more for the quality of this browser.
