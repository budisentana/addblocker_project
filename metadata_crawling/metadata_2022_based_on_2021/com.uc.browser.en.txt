It keeps coming back causing to cancel over and over again. It causes lags on my smartphone. Might give it a try in the far, far future. They still need to fix their embedded player to quit nullifing default video player. A real PITA for those of us who like a great quality player over theirs or your native one.","What did you do? Dude, no. This was my go-to app precisely because speed mode ignored most javascript and I could have a clean home page. Now the \"lite\" setting is completely ignored, and not only can I not have a clean home page (headlines is sticky) with only the links I want, if it gets swiped at all, it takes over and I have to hit back to get the homepage links back; subtle, but really annoying. Now I have to go on the hunt for a new browser that does what UC Mini *used* to do.","Works adequately, but with loads of annoyances and bits of poor interface design that drag its usefulness down. Latest update caused many aggravations and reminded me how the app is littered with bad design decisions that are small individually but add up to a frustrating user experience. I first installed it hoping it would be simple and small. Rooting around in settings has been anything but simple and its data footprint on my device storage has bloated up from ~20mb early on to 140+mb now","Very practical because it takes me to the pages I want to search for immediately. Look, it does not weigh as much as it's full version but it does give you the info when you need it instantly. Even though it's very common seeing small and poor quality of the ads you see through some pages, it does not matter at all if you don't care about them","Before, it was good, and it is my pick to do just about anything; watching videos, reading, and even download some pictures. But now I'm disappointed. The UI are almost identical to UC Browser. In fact, when updating, I was confused whether I'm actually downloading UC Browser or updating UC Mini. I uninstall & reinstall and well, bummer. Anyway, apart from what other reviews said (which is true), there's a technical problem with the latest update. UC Mini supposed to have its personal video playback and it does have it, except it doesn't work (anymore), and the original video you're watching will play but without visual graphic. Only sound."],"appId":"com.uc.browser.en","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uc.browser.en&hl=en&gl=us"}
