Will occasionally block things outside of the schedule I've set which can be a bit annoying. And Android doesn't always cooperate well, but not the apps fault. Would be nice if it were possible to block apps in pop-up view as well, ended up having to add second solution to prevent that. Overall a solid app especially after subscribing.","I paid for the annual subscription on March 29th but honestly, this app has always been hit or miss. Today the app freaked out and suddenly turned on Do Not Disturb mode. It couldn't be turned off no matter what, and even after uninstalling my phone said BlockSite was still controlling Do Not Disturb. Now, after reinstalling, I can't restore the annual subscription purchase. This app is a glitchy mess that only works part of the time. Don't waste your time or money. I just want a refund.","The app works fine and intended. However, the advertising for this app is too aggressive. I never of this app until I downloaded it and set it up. Now pretty much every ad on YouTube is trying to convince me to get an app I already have. I tried to ignore it, but it's too much. I started blocking ads, but I'm still doing it as they're are many. Even as I come to the play store, it recommends to all in the ad section. It's ridiculous amount of ads.","While it is a great app for avoiding distractions, helps me stay on pace with my responsibilities and keeps me from wasting time, I have one issue. It blocks an app/site for most of the time, but at a certain point it stops blocking and you have to unblock and block once more, frequently. If. Not for this constant issue, I would definitely recommend.","You can't use it at all unless you pay a significant amount. More expensive a month than your streaming services. A waste of time. Don't bother. All the app does, is constantly try to get you to pay. You can do NOTHING, until you pay a premium. I do mean A PREMIUM!!! My experience with the app, well I couldn't use it at all. Because you can literally do nothing until you pay. As far as ADS go, there's a ton. It sucks. One star."],"appId":"co.blocksite","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.blocksite&hl=en&gl=us"}
