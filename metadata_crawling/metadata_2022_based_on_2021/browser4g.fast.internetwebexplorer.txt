Very unusual for me. I'm glad I came across this 8 ball app. i will enjoy this 8 ball pool game for some time to come. but there are aspects off this particular game that have me perplexed, and that is somehow some players can controll the cue ball even when they should not be able to, and dictate the game on thier terms and go on to win the game, even when it should have been my game to dictate, and or even win. 8 ball cheats","So far so good interms of speed but it has problems with the back buttom which loses the back page and its easily overwelmed by adds on other sites ,you cannot download a movie when adds start poping up as it will keep on redirecting you. If only you can work on those two. Thank you.","Love it. It has really been of help, instead of me using so much data to download the big size UC browser for the sake of browsing, i just used a little data to av dis one which has given me wat i needed from the bigger version. It's great.","This a great app it's been very helpful to me.I recommend this app to any one who may have network signal problems,I own an ASUS SELFIE ZENFONE 2 and I wasn't getting any 4g signal here in Florida and, ever since I install the app I can surf the web smoothly,also dont have as many drop calls as before.","The fastest browser I have ever used, it's so easy to use and to download movies. I watch movies a lot and this browser is one great tool in handy for me. Pls editors, it wasn't really easy for me to get this app, take good care of it, and thanks"],"appId":"browser4g.fast.internetwebexplorer","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=browser4g.fast.internetwebexplorer&hl=en&gl=us"}
