Please relaunch and the problems will be fixed.","comments":["This redesign of the mobile browser interface is visionary and bordering on genius. It has such a huge impact on me. I have uninstalled Firefox and Duckduckgo. They suddenly seem so old-fashioned and outdated. Congratulations on a fantastic app. I look forward to further progress.","The real Falkon browser is still in active development but was never available for Android. This fake thing has not been updated since 2015. Install at your own risk.","I'm fully satisfied with this apps.","I used this a good while ago and remember liking it then but forgot the name of it after installing another os on my phone. Luckily google tracks everything and found it in the history of apps that used to update lol. Anyways will come back and rate it 5 stars if it is as good as i remember.","I very much like your browser.  Excellent design.  I love that it doesn't need many permissions, that it's small and fast,  and I love the falkon bar operation.  There's one issue that seems to have gotten worse lately however, that the issue of crashing.   Please fix this issue.   I love your browser."],"appId":"com.haasinc.falKonpp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haasinc.falKonpp&hl=en&gl=us"}
