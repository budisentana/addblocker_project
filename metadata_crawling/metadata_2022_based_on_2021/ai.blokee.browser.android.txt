For example, how do you add a bookmark without having the type in the name and the URL rather than just clicking a button? There are other simple actions that simply could not figure out how to use. There are better Ad Blocking browsers out there like Brave, and Chrome with extensions does a superb job of blocking ads everywhere. I've tried out 20+ browsers over the years, and this was the most non-intuitive one ever. Uninstalled.","Blocket is the best YouTube ad blocker I've tried (and I've tried 12 of them). It very reliablely block YouTube adds, and makes watching YouTube a much better experience. Contains adds, but all the features are completely free. Highly recommended! My only request is to make the skip ahead interval adjustable so you can skip ahead 30 seconds at a time. Other than that, great browser!","I can stay focused and comprehend better because I'm not being interrupted with commercials. That is good for research. Plus if you're looking at something that makes you feel better , some commercials can send you back in a depressed mode. Some commercial remind us of what we are trying to escape","I only use this app for Youtube so look for other reviews for other stuff. App loads pretty quickly, sometimes it takes a couple of seconds to load a video on Youtube. It's not because the app is glitchy. On the right of the Url bar there is a little shield that displays how many ads are being stopped. I suspect that is the reason for the delay. Other than that no complaints.","Ads had become so prevalent and intrusive I no longer liked surfing the internet or reading the news anymore. My phone screen would be bombarded with ads of ask sorts: huge banner ads at the bottom, ads sliding in from the sides, pop-up ads - you name it. And the worst thing was that my content kept getting reformatted to accommodate the ads making it really frustrating to pick up where I was interrupted. So far this app is a HUGE improvement.
