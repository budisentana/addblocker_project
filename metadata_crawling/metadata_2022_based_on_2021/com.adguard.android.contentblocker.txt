Bought it as a lifetime purchase. after 2 years it stopped working as it was supposed to do, now all the ads are on the screen as before, either on the computer desk or on the smartphone and it's annoying. Now they demand that I subscribe to the premium program, which is essentially the same amount as for the lifetime program. I see no reason to continue to subscribe with them, because in a year or two they will again stop working properly.","When you run the app, setup everything you want enabled, and then restart your phone; you'll get a solid experience when you start to notice that your phones battery can last a whole day on a single charge while running Adguard in the background 24/7. This means it's incredibly lightweight & doesn't boggle down the performance of your phone with no compensation for either & it does a very good job of preventing ads. Especially in games. Though if you have this on, you'll block video ads, etc.","Well, it definitely does what it says it will do. I got tired of getting bombarded with ads browsing Chrome trying to look up tutorials for video games, but I'd get pop up ads and banner ads that made for a bad mobile browsing experience. Was worried I'd need to spend money to achieve this, but free version worked just fine. If I really wanted to watch YouTube ad free, I can do that on my PC.","I came across adguard YEARS ago before they were on mobile. I was exhausted with all the adds in the world. It was the best discovery I ever made, I have it on my computer, obviously, but have added it to my phone as well and it's so unobtrusive yet the absolute best for security and add blocking. Don't let the name fool you, it's multifunctional. Can't give enough praise and recommendations!!!","Great protection! Great value. It says and does what it needs to do to protect you and your surfing. The only issue I came up with is when you allow the VPN authentication, sometimes your WiFi experience will suffer. Instead of the 250+ down, I'd get 30 or less. I narrowed it down to that authentication. When I deleted it and restarted the phone I get normal speeds now. It occurred twice when experimenting with that particular certificate for VPN. Play with it. With or without VPN, it's an A"],"appId":"com.adguard.android.contentblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adguard.android.contentblocker&hl=en&gl=us"}
