I had ads on my phone for like 3 months, I've tried 20+ apps to stop them and this is the only one that worked. The source of the pop up ads was an app with no name. This app was able to track it down then I deleted it so much. If you have the same problem I highly recommend this app. Thanks again.","üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç For MONTHS I had UNWANTED Pop-up Ads that took over my phone, I couldn't make calls or text without interruptions.

The problem app that you found, a noise level meter, was loaded over a year ago and just started kicking out ads last month."],"appId":"co.easy4u.popup.ads.detector","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.easy4u.popup.ads.detector&hl=en&gl=us"}
