I have used about 20-25 internet browsers before but I have never found such a good and advanced browser! That's why it is my daily companion! I prefer it for its fast speed and small size! Although there are some bugs! 1) Even if the browser history is deleted, it is not deleted but remains! 2) if i go to Incognito mode in the browser, it remains in normal mode! But except for these few things, everything else is very nice Browser! Recommended!","Because of the new character limit the google play store has and Google's policy prevents links to other sites, I can't make my usual in depth reviews here anymore. However, on most devices, this is one of the best browsers I've used. It's small, the ad blocker works almost perfectly and the browser is very fast. The only issues I have are videos in hd have buffering issues and specifically on my tablet (hp7, running android 4.1.2), most websites don't work properly and the browser is unstable.","This is the best lite browser I have used, and I have tried many. Most, while small in size, compromise features and usability. Via, in the other hand, has no such compromises, and offers multiple useful features, such as the ability to choose custom user interface, import bookmarks, ad blocker, and built in QR scanner. It is also highly customizable, and allows you to save/export/import your settings. It is speedy, doesn't bog down my phone, and has great privacy features. Useful! I love it!","I wish I were to be able to adjust the maximum height of the pop-up menu when you hold a link. If you long-press a link, it'll bring up a pop-up menu (\"Open in Background/Open in New Tab/etc.\") which takes up 30% of my screen--and if I happen to be long-pressing a link on the bottom half of my screen, the \"Open in Background\" option will shift all the way to the top of my screen. It's quite a stretch ;w; Still the most customizable ad-blocking browser I've used to date. I highly recommend it.","The only issue I had was when you close the browser and open it again the tab seems to have gone 'back' a few times. I closed the browser after chapter 10 of a web novel and when I opened the browser later the tab was at chapter 6. I read a lot and this happens all the time, really annoying. One other feature I missed when using Via was the selected word preview that chrome has. The tab grouping would also be a nice to have. I would've moved from chrome to via if it weren't for these."],"appId":"mark.via.gp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mark.via.gp&hl=en&gl=us"}
