Ad blocking works great. Would like to see folders for shortcuts on the homepage. Also a scroll bar on the side when scrolling through a page. Sometimes in classic menu mode when toggling to full screen mode, the little menu widget doesn't show up and can't get out of full screen without restarting the browser. Still, KUTO is very fast and displays everthing correctly on webpages for me. Love it!","I really wanted this to be good. But app's menu could not be accessed except during initial setup. I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling, choosing the other menu positioning (there are two - pull from the side edge, or place at bottom edge). Same problem. Too bad, because otherwise it seemed so promising. Sorry: no way to use this. Running Android 9.1.","Bringing up the menu is clonky, not smooth and quick. But when fix that switch to a bottom URL design with smart a bottom horizontal tab menu, this will be absolute king. It's both faster and smoother than any of the the other 30 browsers I've tried.","It's decent, the word prediction is broken, it only works for the first word but then it disappears. Edit: I just realised that Google Play Store asked me questions such as \"does this app have group video messaging\" and \"does this app have message receipts\". Very odd, the questions usually relate to the app's functionality, this is a browser.","Basically it's a good lite web browser. The only quirk that I not fond of is when opening new tab for link. It doesn't have an option to open in the background. Kindly add the option to open link in the background."],"appId":"com.kuto.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kuto.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
