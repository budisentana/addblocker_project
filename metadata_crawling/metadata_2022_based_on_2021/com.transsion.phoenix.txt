I was amazed how much faster it is than Firefox. It has the best cleaners period. Tracks your phone junk and memory status in real time 24/7 if you activate notifications. I had several cleaners that all did good jobs individually but the cleaners in this app made me uninstall the others. This is a complete cleaning app. Everything else about this browser is top notch as well.","Dismal. The only think decent about this app is how easy it is to download video when the damn thing isn't freezing up. This app jacked up my phone! It got so bad it was barely working. I had to take my phone to a Samsung repair center. They ran a diagnostic on it and it came back fine the only problem was one app was causing all kinds of issues. I removed the Damned app and we still had to hard reset the phone. It was destroying files saved on the SD card I lost maybe 30 GB of movies all corrup","Unfortunately, this browser does not work correctly, even on popular websites like Amazon. Holding tablet vertically, it would keep auto-scrolling to the left, preventing me from accessing things on the right side of the page. It would make menus open full page that should be just dropdown menus. I liked the way certain features worked, but i can't live with the major issues.","About the 2nd to last update this browser has an annoying bug where it puts up a small colored icon with the site's URL as the page loads, BUT instead of going away this icon sits in the middle of the page and pulses like a heartbeat. It can't be moved, you can't interact with it. You can browse the page in a normal way otherwise, except this annoying, pulsing icon. Clearing the cache doesn't help, nor does a reboot. My device is a galaxy note 3, but other browsers don't have this problem. So?","This browser is nice & speedy. Would be nice if I there was a toggle switch to remove 'most visited' from the homepage. The ability to add a background image to the homepage would also be nice. Maybe even a drop down menu in the search bar to quickly switch between search engines. Also, needs a remeber selection box, to avoid having to keep clicking download every time you save some thing. Even without those features, I still like this browser."],"appId":"com.transsion.phoenix","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.transsion.phoenix&hl=en&gl=us"}
