It's absolutely trustworthy, quick to catch anything and covers all aspects of keeping my phone safe, clean, and healthy. Very easy to use, just set it up and let it run on it's own. You'll hear from it quickly when a threat or a problem shows up. It's sensitive and accurate and provides info about the threat, and gives you the option with several choices in deciding what you want to do about it. Gives peace of mind!","Only 3 stars for a couple of reasons. First, every other AV scan can take up to 12 minutes to completely scan my entire device, SD and attached USB included. ESET took 21 seconds even after I changed the settings to in-depth. Yay! but no. Feels like I'm buying a cheap, plastic knockoff from Wish. Second, during installation I was only given the option to register the app through my Google account, I wasn't able to register with my personal email and manage my subscription with ESET directly.","A good Antivirus Software. I've been using it for over 20 years. However, I'm disappointed with the latest update. One of the best features for the Mobile app was the ability to block unwanted and annoying phone calls and texts. With the new update I've lost that ability due to a new Google Play policy change. I'm currently looking for another app to switch to and seriously thinking of getting rid of my Android phone!","Have used or tested most security suites. It is impossible to say any one product is best (most have strong points), but ESET is very very strong. It is easy to setup, has an excellent interface, is light on system resources, and has excellent scores from AV testing services. Subscription price is a bit higher than some competitors, but ESET is well worth the cost. Customer service appears to be very good. A standout product. Highly recommended.","Reliable and well established. I've been counting on ESET off & on for well over a decade. Lots and lots of use on PCs, but the Android use is new. I would like to second the request for a VPN in the app. To close- 1 question: if I don't want to switch my debugging settings, isn't there some way to wipe the issue away so I don't ALWAYS have unresolved issues on the main screen & check ins? If I want USB Debugging Mode, I want it! Tell the app that for me, will ya? lol OverallESEThasRocked4years"],"appId":"com.eset.ems2.gp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eset.ems2.gp&hl=en&gl=us"}
