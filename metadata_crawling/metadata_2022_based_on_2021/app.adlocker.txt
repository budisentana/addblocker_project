They were difficult because I download many apps that doesn't come in the app store. Every time I would open almost any app afterwards, popups would occur. But once I installed AdLocker app, no pop-ups in any apps that I now use. Much,much better then even I could have hoped for. Thanks guys üëèüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç.","Honestly this is the best ad blocker and I loved it so much I paid the very affordable price for a year subscription, it seems to not want to restore my subscription status after deleting the app and later reinstalling it. Otherwise itd be 5 stars.","I think it works. Just dont know how to verify further. I noticed some of my apps dont display ads anymore when I turn adlocker on. Some apps still play ads upon openning the first time then disappears after. Just realised Im the first one to give this app a review. I must commend you on this. Good job! Hope we can view details of the blocked thread and the deleted ads in the future. Cheers!","No other app worked so well with blocking ads in every app, and with the newest update suddenly it tells me my subscription has expired when I've been using it without issues for free for longer than a week (the free trial length). Not happy.","it works for a while. then you get a notification saying that your free trial is up. then you would have yo pay to get rid of ads, but its good for a long time."],"appId":"app.adlocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.adlocker&hl=en&gl=us"}
