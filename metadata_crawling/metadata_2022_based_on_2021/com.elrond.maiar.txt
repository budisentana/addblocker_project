It's very fast, even on an old phone with 1GB RAM, and the \"request desktop site\" function works right on web pages where it wouldn't on other browsers. The UI is also pretty clear to use and the password saving feature works well. Not sure if it would be possible to integrate this but an across-device sync feature would be great, for example by using your Microsoft account.","It is good. Just when you play a clip in YouTube and reach min(10:30)-ex. If you click mistankley in other clip and you want to go back to the main clip. It will start from bigining not from where reached(10:30). I am not sure if can be adjusted in YouTube setting or this a feature should be available in browser. In overall , feel very speed compared to others.","This browser is really good but it has some bugs. The developers need to create a option to make an individual maiar account where we can store passwords and other data just in case our phone gets stolen. App also has a few bugs. But overall its great. Ive been using it since they released it when it had less than 50 reviews i think. The developers need to listen to people and make changes. Overall this browser can beat chrome, opera or the default browser on the phone","It is ok to a considerable extent in term ad blocking Https everywhere, DuckDuckgo, tracking and so on. But for me a browser that establishes itself as a privacy browser MUST include a VPN because with all the ad block, etc. if your IP address is still exposed then...??? But as I said it is a good app when looking at all the features at all the features and would recommend it none the less.","I could love this browser but it doesn't seems so. The overall UI is uninteresting and uninspiring despite being a complete copycat of Chrome and Brave. No webpage translation option or happening. The downbar hides options like \"simplified view\". The black theme is a turn-off. No dark mode. If you open sites like Twitter, YouTube instead of opening the page it opens in the app. No pop-up video player option. App size crosses 100mb. Nothing unique. Crashes N a lot of bugs.👎"],"appId":"com.elrond.maiar","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elrond.maiar&hl=en&gl=us"}
