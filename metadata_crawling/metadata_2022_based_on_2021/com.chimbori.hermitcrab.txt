Don’t just post reviews saying it’s a browser! 😎 https://hermit.chimbori.com/features/compare<br>— 👑 Block tracking parameters from URLs! (Premium feature)<br>— Download and use higher-quality icons wherever available<br>— Auto-discover feeds when adding new Lite Apps<br>— Tablet-optimized layouts for many screens<br>— Downloads: New fixes for mis-configured servers that send blank filenames","comments":["1)block sketchy sites from redirecting to malware or scammaz pages. I just want to watch anime in peace ;_; (Microsoft Edge used to be able to withstand redirects) 2)bookmarking a page sends me back to a lite app's target URL or homepage. I have to tap the back button to get back to the page I was on. 3)The navigation panel (refresh, forward, etc) dissappears constantly and in order to make it reappear I have to increase or decrease font.","I found this app a few months ago, thought I'd give it a try now. So far is awesome, takes up no memory space and has some mini apps available. It quickly mentions about making custom apps, I'm a little behind in being tech savvy enough to know where to find the way that's done. I've swapped the apps I have for Hermits mini versions with success and they work great and I can tell the phone runs faster.","September 24, 2021 Update!! I would like to suggest an export-import option for lite apps, whether pre-configured or self-configured, especially for those of us who are uninstalling and reinstalling apps constantly. It would save people from having to retype the names of websites from scratch to recreate their lite apps. It's just a thought. I still enjoy using Hermit.","Came across this app long back but didn't understand the need of it . It was suggested recently by many people in suggestion threads & wanted to try it out. Pretty useful app & saves a ton of space on the device. They have apps for most of the websites that I frequently browse so I'm completely satisfied with it. Not to forget the different customization options it provides .Totally worth switching to.","App seems very very useful and I'd love it more.if it didn't keep crashing on my phone. Seems like every other time I enter the app it freezes than crashes soon after. Some of the interface could use a bit of polish and customization but that's nitpicking. This app as the dev says is for power users. Hopefully an update in the future will fix my issues and I can try this again."],"appId":"com.chimbori.hermitcrab","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chimbori.hermitcrab&hl=en&gl=us"}
