Shows \"performance boost\" as an issue after completed scans with a persistent notification that's really annoying. I haven't been able to find a full scan option, just a smart scan which I assume isn't as thorough. Subscription cancelled, app uninstalled.","Very frustrated. Every time I open up the app and make a selection, I get a pop up telling me the app is not responding and it asks if I want to wait or close the app. I also have a trojan that shows up in the scan, but there is no clear way to remove it. Or at least I can't figure it out before the app crashes. DL from Playstore Chrome OS Once the app is fixed, I will try it again. With all the features that are available, I was really excited to give it a try. I Hope to see it get fixed.","I am a paid user for Prime subscription. I really like their softwares for Windows. It has improved dramatically over a year, and the best I have ever seen on the Market. However, the apps for the Android on the other hand has bugs. For instance, even tho I have enable permission on certain features in the setting, the app still shows that I haven't enable it yet. For one other feature, it won't let me enable this particular permission the setting. It also blocks me using my camera. Disappointed","It's free and scans your phone. You can't simply scan a folder. It will repeatedly, annoyingly tell you there's \"performance optimizations\" when I've told it not to perform performance optimizations. If it's this unwieldy free, it's not for me. This is just a free solution if you think you downloaded something nasty, otherwise I wouldn't bother with it.","Never noticed whether it actually stopped or blocked anything malicious on my phone. But, the app consumes 82% of my battery life, and severely degrades my cell phone's performance! Plus, the battery monitor with ad notification window keeps popping up repeatedly, making it nearly impossible to use my device. Can't figure out how to uninstall it either. They need to fix this app!"],"appId":"com.avira.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avira.android&hl=en&gl=us"}
