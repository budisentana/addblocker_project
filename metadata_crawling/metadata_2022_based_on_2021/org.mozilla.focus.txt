I'll re-review in a few weeks if any issues arise, but I really dig that it automatically erases all the pages after I close my browser. Regular Firefox says it will do that, but it doesn't ever close them. I'll have 27 pages open by noon ðŸ™„ Firefox needs to fix that on their original app. Maybe the new, separate browser is the fix ðŸ¤”","This has been my go-to browser for quite some time, and will likely continue to be, but I wouldn't recommend using it for downloading large files. Stability in that area is severely lacking. I regularly end up with broken files and have to start over. That, and they tend to outright fail if you veer away from the site you were on. Overall, though, for regular web browsing, it doesn't get much better than this. Simple, fast, and secure.","Based on first expressions, the app is pretty good. I downloaded it to replace the normal Firefox app as the original is too overwhelming for me to use in a mobile format. The only problems I really have are that it could be a little bit faster, and it would be nice if it had a search bar widget, like the original app.","Feedback if these are being monitored: the sound button popup when viewing a gif or a video is super distracting and I'm always trashing it as soon as it appears. Please give us a setting to turn that off permanently. Otherwise, my go to phone browser. Love the built in privacy settings and the help cleaning up after a session.","Simple and clean browser for specifically when you want to focus. It's a niche use, as there are no bookmarks, no multiple tabs, and no history saved. Essentially, it's equivalent to browsing incognito, but Incognito is on at all times. It's great for what it's for what it's designed for, but anyone who wants more should look elsewhere."],"appId":"org.mozilla.focus","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus&hl=en&gl=us"}
