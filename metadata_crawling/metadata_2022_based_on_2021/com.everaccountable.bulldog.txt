But a couple months ago, it allowed uninstall while active. I tested it a few times and it no longer blocks attempts, even with admin permissions enabled. I emailed them several times to troubleshoot, and never once received a response. If they'd get back with me, or fixed the issue, I'd gladly come right back, but it currently does no good as is.","The difficulty and time that comes with having to turn of the filter does help with avoiding relapses, however the filter isn't perfect. It blocks a good chunk of porn sites but there are still a handful of sites that the filter ignores. So i usually end up just blocking chrome altogether. Overall I think it is one of the better filters out there, and I hope that they fix the glaring issues that I currently have with it in the near future.","Bulldog Blocker is like a TANK. My favorite part is that it is 100 percent free. Nothing gets through its safesearch, you can't uninstall it with the blocker on. The security keeps you from making a bad choice, as you can either set a timer or a pin to turn off the blocker. There is also an option to send the pin to another person so that only they can turn it off. From the bottom of my heart, I truly thank you for this app and the help it has given me as a recovering porn addict.","I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I love it. It's much more than just a DNS based blocker. They send daily tips that feel very supportive and timely and make me feel not so alone in the battle. While the blocker isn't perfect and can't find everything, no pre-made blocker can. If you have a porn addiction this is absolutely a great step in the right direction. Strongly recommend.","I've tried to completely quit porn for a long time, but my willpower would always eventually fail. I finally realized that there are technological solutions to this technological problem. This app makes it impossible for me to succumb in a moment of weakness, because I threw away the PIN and have to wait 3 hours to disable it! Even better, it's free and doesn't require you to involve anyone else. I've also set up several layers of filtering and safe search on my computer and router."],"appId":"com.everaccountable.bulldog","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.everaccountable.bulldog&hl=en&gl=us"}
