","comments":["I run it on Android 8.1, but have used it for years as far back as Android 4. I do one thing with it. That's a one-time complete scan, monthly. For this manually initiated task, it's rock-steady reliable... the one software I have used which will 'custom' scan all parts of my storage & the system files. This job takes about an hour & accesses about one million files. It has never hung up or otherwise faltered.","The BEST free av for Android. I trust it with any downloaded app. Custom scanning, constant updates, simple and easy interface. If and when it does shut off, just keep the widget on and click, you're covered when installing new things. If you don't feel 100%, scan online with virus total. Everytime I do, it's clean just like Dr web stated. Also saved me from a few bad installs.","Dr web now located in Kazakhstan? I think people were just kidding about not using your app because of the invasion. Just for raw scanning function s, this is a must have tool. I didn't like apps that reside in memory all the time as a monitor. One too many automatic apps like that will cause congestion.","I'm using Dr web light since late 2014 and I must say in 2022, its just a substandard version of what great it was. Earlier it used to scan links & messages from messaging apps like WhatsApp, telegram & browser searches (apart from chrome) & I use to know about malicious links & scams but now it doesnt. I promoted your av because of this and they thanked me but now it scans with no issues even when I have trojan apk & adware app & fraudulent support numbers from search engines. Uninstalled. üí©","I have tested it in android studio using realtime malware samples from Github ,unfortunately it failed to detect even a single one ! I don't recommend it to download ! I will test it again but for now it's pretty straight forward no no for me!! THANK YOU DEV TEAM!!üôè"],"appId":"com.drweb","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drweb&hl=en&gl=us"}
