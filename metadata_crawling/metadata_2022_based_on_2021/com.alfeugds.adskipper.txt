Though some times you can hear an add for 1 to 2 seconds but that is rare. It also instantly skips them too but If you have your YouTube video playing and you exit the app the video may minimize, the add skiper will not be able to skip the add when the YouTube video is minimized.","Absolute trash. it DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. Simply I downloaded it,gave it accessibility access then opened YouTube to test it. Ads play so smoothly,they never mute and after 5 seconds they never auto skip even when the skip button is appearant. It doesn't do what it says it does. There something malicious about this app.","Skips when available and mutes ads on YouTube. Nice沽. I keep getting the same efood ads over and over on every video. I have them沽､ It's ok but could you add exceptions list? In Minion Rush ads stop appearing but I need to play them if I want to get the rewards they give. I just turned off ad skipper now but it would be better if I didn't have to turn it on and off for some apps.","I have used it in my other phone earlier but I have bought tablet so please optimize this app for tablet because it doesn't work well in tablet","Keeps turning off in the accessibility when the my phones shuts down or restarts"],"appId":"com.alfeugds.adskipper","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alfeugds.adskipper&hl=en&gl=us"}
