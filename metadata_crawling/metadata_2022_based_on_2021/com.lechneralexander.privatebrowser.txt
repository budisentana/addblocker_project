First, on my tablet (Hp 7, running android 4.1.2) the browser doesn't really work, it just closes itself before webpages are actually given a chance to load. Second, on all of my other devices the ad blocker doesn't seem to actually block ads. Other than those two issues the browser was pretty good, but there are better browsers available and this browser hasn't been updated in over a year.","This app is very good. Small size. Always clear history and cache on exit. I want to give 5 stars, but there is one feature not available in this app. You know UC Browser? In UC Browser, when you play any video from any website, UC Browser automatically have the Download button, so the user can download the video instantly, and I always download any video that I want to re-watch later. I hope you can add this feature in your next update.","I have used this app for years, and It has been a great tool. My only gripe is that I can't carry over bookmarks, or even find the app data to do it myself. If they allowed book-mark exporting and importing, it would be perfect, especially when a ohone croaks like mine did 2 years back. (I lost all my bookmarks ;( )","Not sure how private this actually is. I had a bunch of bookmarks saved, which refuse to delete despite uninstalling the app several times and ensuring all the residual data is deleted. Reinstall the app and all the old bookmarks are back! So where exactly are they being saved? Presumably on a server somewhere. Very bizarre.","Really like this browser. No ads! Fast and works well with any phone I have used it on. Only drawback is that often it's not compatible with an increasing number of websites. But I use it until I can't , then switch to another then asap switch back to this app. I like it a lot."],"appId":"com.lechneralexander.privatebrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lechneralexander.privatebrowser&hl=en&gl=us"}
