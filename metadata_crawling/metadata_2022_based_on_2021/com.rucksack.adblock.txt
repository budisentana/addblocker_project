Installed this a few days ago because while playing games, I was forced to watch 30 second ads after EVERY move. I don't mind an ad every now and then, but game developers are getting ridiculous with commercials ad nauseum. Some of the ads are often very explicit and inappropriate. Adblock has been performing very well. I haven't seen an ad since I installed it. The reason for 4 stars is because I have to manually go into the app and turn it on upon restarting my phone.","Wonderful, though not perfect. It definitely blocks lots of ads, comparing with it vs without it in Google News, for instance. And sometimes a page has a box inside it with a big beautiful error in it, because it failed trying to load some ad. And the rest of the page is just fine for reading, with no obnoxious ad sucking bandwidth to try and interfere with everything else. But some ads do still appear, although they are the kind of static less obtrusive image that can easily be scrolled over.","Very effective against blocking most banner and pop-up ads in most of the apps that I use. Doesn't work in YouTube, although I have it in my \"not bypassed\" list. Has to be turned back on after a specific time has passed, but starts working immediately after being restarted. Highly recommend, for what it's worth!","It works! I had this game that was constantly interrupting me with ads every 5 seconds, & after I flipped the switch for that app, the ads stopped showing up. It also made the app not lag & crash, which means I was right about the ads being the cause of the lag. Edit: Haven't been able to get it to work after restsrting. Now it just uses RAM & does nothing.","At first it was working, and it was a REALLY good ad blocker, one of the apps i was using it on, was one spewing out 4 ads every break at 10 ads per second, and it was working fine for 3 days, but then it stoped working period and I don't really know how to fix it, I made sure it was set to the app I was trying to ad block and I also tried different DNS to fix it, I really like this but i think I might need to find a new add blocker since it doesn't work like it used too."],"appId":"com.rucksack.adblock","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rucksack.adblock&hl=en&gl=us"}
