So now with this application we have the option. \n\nI am not against blocking advertisements but it should be an option or at least advertised that the ROM has a pre-installed ad blocker.\n\nIf you have any questions about this application send me an email at aV1rusApps@gmail.com.","descriptionHTML":"****READ THIS DESCRIPTION**** <br>ROOTED PHONES ONLY<br>I cannot stress enough this is for ROOTED DEVICES!!!

I had problems shopping  using Chrome. At the top of the search result is a section to scroll left or right. When I would click on one, some of them would be rejected and not open the desired web page.  Target was one of the stores I had the most problems with. I found one of those poblem links, tried to open it with failure. Then used this app and my problem is solved. I can use those links now.","I installed an ad free version of the stock international rom on my sgh-i317m months ago, thinking it was the best choice. I soon realized it limited my browsing ability, since some links route through ad services first. My most recent dilema was downloading packages for Babbel. After using your tool everything downloaded perfectly.","So far so good. Works on Asus ZenPad 8, rooted. Got an app i need, which i couldn't even pass the first setup page due to ads per second. This app just did it for me... sometimes, maybe once every 5 to 10 minutes i still get a banner ad on that stupid app, but gets easily fixed by going back button and reload, and also keep cleaning your app's cache. Anyhow, i highly recommend  this adblocker. Thank you kindly dear devs.   Update: Here i am again on my ZenFone 3 Laser droid 7.1.1 rooted, works like a charm.","I am running cyanogenmod 11 on a galaxy s3 with root access. I gave the app root permission and backed up successfully.
