Like, the boring ads of Facebook, Youtube and most of other browsing ads. That's literally awesome! I didnâ€™t think that it will work, but surprisingly it works and I'm glad to find this app and review it as the first user reviewer!","This app does 0. Nothing at all! It sits idle and just takes space. It is an absolute waste of time. I've tested and tested to see its functionality and I've come to the conclusion that I have done nothing less than waste my time. This apps \"positive reviews\" are fake and developer created. UNINSTALLED!","I think this app really works! I've had my phone screen rotate without turning on the auto rotation setting on my phone and found out some one was tapping into my phone watching me. When I download this app along with another phone blocking tracking app I realized I was right. This app stopped \"ALL\" of that and I have'nt had any issues with that so far","Slow. Pages won't open, using a DNS outside your country makes it even slower. Want USA channels in Canada, be prepared to wait, forever. I'm going back to a regular VPN. This app is complicated and SLOW. And we pretty much have to assume that the 12,000 trackers it states that it has blocked in less than 18 hours of use it accurate. Talk is cheap, where's the hardcore proof?","It's awesome. Just download this and use, it's a must have for everyone. It filters out all those annoying ads and videos that pop up in some apps. It further gives you a smooth browsing experience and internet speed has increased incredibly well. It is a true NoTrack. Much love to the developers of this app."],"appId":"com.rucksack.adblock.anti_tracking","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rucksack.adblock.anti_tracking&hl=en&gl=us"}
