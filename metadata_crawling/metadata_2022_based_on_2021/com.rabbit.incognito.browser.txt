Just sometimes loading can feel a little... Janky, not always super smooth, but its still ok, there is unfortunately no home tab or new tabs too make, you must search everything on one tab :( But there are multiple over browsers that have the same problem but all and all, i think it's a decent browser!","App is working ok. It still has some bugs and glitches where as, sometimes won't open a website or crashes, but works alot better! Also would be nice if forward and back tabs were added to the browser. Thanks for the improvements you have provided!","Private Brower is very useful browser and it is well designed application. It is so simple and easy. It provides proper speed. Its working is amazing. You can also enjoyed.","Incognito browser provide you the privacy. It don't save history hence you can easily search. I think its a good browser for people who have concerns about privacy.","Private browser is a nice browser. Very easy to use. You can select different options there. In short it's a perfect browser for everything."],"appId":"com.rabbit.incognito.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rabbit.incognito.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
