Love the random pin it allows one to set to block themselves from turning app off when they are just getting started and haven't found an accountability buddy yet. Sometimes it's hard to build up the nerve to ask someone to set a pin for you. This allows you to ask Detoxify to do it and immediately start detoxifying. One of the best blockers I've ever used. They thought of everything!","It does what it says for sure, I've been a porn addict for a while but this app works at stopping me from getting to those sites. HOWEVER I feel like some of the features can be used in very malicious ways. Such as locking your phone 5 minutes I under stand but a week is way too far (To be fair it still allows emergency contacts). Your friends can see and deny you turning/deleting the app and a lot of other features I believe to be unreasonable.","This is probably the best web filter I've found to specifically block pornography.   The app doesn't take much space or battery power consumption, and it is extremely intuitive and easy to use. The best feature of the app is that it allows you to assign a random pin, effectively preventing you from being able to uninstall it when the urges are particularly bad.   My only, tiny gripe is that the three day trial seems too short. Anyone familiar with a reboot knows it take at least seven days to feel a noticeable difference in mental clarity and energy. However, the upgrade only costs 5 dollars a month and Pete (who is super responsive!) gives you a chance to get that first month refunded :)   If you are anything like me and have been (unsuccessfully) trying to quit porn off of sheer willpower, and are considering external resources, this a   great place to start.","An absolutely amazing app. I've been able to resist the temptation when I can see it building up, but when it comes up suddenly I struggle with resisting 'in the moment'. I loved that while I was stuck 'in the moment' during the free trial I actually had the time I needed to change my thinking when I couldn't access any of the sites. When the free trial ended, unfortunately so did my streakâ€” which goes to show how effective the app is. Just started monthly payments, so here goes!","For many years, I've been struggling to finding an adult content blocker that actually worked. i've only had this one for about a week, but it seems to work perfectly so far! unlike other programs which have many issues with consistency/compatability with search engines, I've tested it on other browsers and its been very consistent. I couldn't be happier to finally have some electronic assistance (that actually works!) with detoxifying."],"appId":"com.familyfirsttechnology.pornblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.familyfirsttechnology.pornblocker&hl=en&gl=us"}
