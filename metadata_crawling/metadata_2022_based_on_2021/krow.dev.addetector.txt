The scan took literally one second and found an unnamed app that was not only the one showing both small and full screen pop up ads (porn ones at that) on my phone but also had access to my location, camera and more! Its finally gone! You do need to look through the list and find the guilty app. One suggestion would be to set a start time so it could run until an ad is shown and log ad events to see what app launched it, if possible, but this worked great for me! Thank you!","Fantastic app. Easy to use. Ran a scan. Clicked through a couple likely culprits (all games, or any apps I didn't recognize), dismissing ones that had used zero data. Sure enough, solitaire, which I'd never installed nor played, had used data. Removed and problem solved. app team should include when installed and bandwidth used since X on the overall summary page; my only gripe was that this info wasn't on the summary, but not enough to mark this app down (I personally didn't have many).","Found the mysterious app popping up ads on my phone in the blink of an eye. I had looked carefully through my downloaded apps and the offending app did not appear in the list. Ad Detector took me right to where I could uninstall the offending app, which had no name in the phone's application manager and didn't show up in the list. Great!","Did the Job: it list all the apps that run ads but here's the tricky part. you yourself have to look for the recently downloaded apps that could be causing your new problem with Ads. 1. look at your phone for apps you recently downloaded. (and didn't download). 2. run the Apps scan. 3. In the list, find the names of ones you recently downloaded. click on them. look to see if they have used unusual amounts of memory. 4. force stop the suspicious memory using apps. 5. see if the ads stop.","Should have done this way sooner. I had pop-up ads everywhere, bleeding through not only Facebook, but every other place. So totally annoying! This App has literally stopped all of it. Very easy to use. Give it a couple hours and it will take care of all those pesky freaking ads. YES!"],"appId":"krow.dev.addetector","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=krow.dev.addetector&hl=en&gl=us"}
