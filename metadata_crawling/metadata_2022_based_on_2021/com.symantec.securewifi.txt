I've had the service through my Norton subscription for several years. I like the ability to use VPN at public venues, but every couple of weeks the app stops even attempting to connect to a VPN backend. Even when hitting the connect button, the app immediately responds that it can't connect. I need to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work again.","This is an updated review based on the latest update. Overall, I like what is done with the app, it looks now better, more modern, and even feels faster than before. Connection wise I was satisfied with what the app used to offer and I still am. Unfortunately, the update completely disregarded some necessary app functionality that are now considered basic in other app rivals such as landscape mode and quick settings menu shortcut. It seems that the app will take some time to pick up.","The app is hard to use. I originally got this on my pc, payed for subscription and everything, but I can't even login on my phone cus the app won't even let me get past the \"I agree\" button without glitching at least 10 times. The app itself is slow and hard to manage. After my 30th attempt I was able to log in but it didn't even load because the slowness of the app. And yes, i got the bundle for multiple devices.","Twice in approximately one month, my account comes up as EXPIRED. I've got a year left on on my subscription, that. I definitely regret. Zero customer service. I don't want to shift through a million articles, I don't want to code. I WANT WHAT I PAID FOR. I can't adjust settings; they're blocked with an \"expired\" , IT'S NOT.","Well after ongoing issues of having to reload the app multiple times, as recommended by Norton customer service, because of a bug in the programming I have to change my review. The bug is when VPN is activated it will eventually prevent connectivity to websites. Yep. So two stars because when it works it does do random locations but that is it. Do not recommend this product."],"appId":"com.symantec.securewifi","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.symantec.securewifi&hl=en&gl=us"}
