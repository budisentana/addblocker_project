They were actually just recommending the Real-Time scan, which is free. Sorry for the misinfo. Scanned my phone and told me they found 1 issue. Nothing in the logs about it. Turns out my \"issue\" is I haven't turned on Real-Time scanning. Ok, I agree this is an important feature but don't scare people and call it an issue. All in all, Trend it seems you have a good thing going. This app seems solid and very thorough. Thank you","This app is free antivirus security Very comprehensive ,easy to use. There's ad's but not overwhelming or forceful. I recommend this app for anyone who wants a good antivirus security suite. My personal experience was this I thought wow great app. Then it froze up. Stopped working and other apps weren't working properly. I tried contacting the developers haven't heard from them yet. I had to uninstall it. I bet the will contact me though to change my review. Be careful with this app.","If you want the quality anti-virus for free, then use this. This app has all the premium features that you need to pay in other applications like Avast. The only feature it doesn't has is location tracker. But I am fine with it since I have premium anti-virus subscription from another provider. I use this, in addition to other anti-virus softwares to protect my device 99%. I only write reviews when I have problems with the app. This app is literally same system as and from Trend Micro. Thanks!","Banking app not opening: After installing this app and running the scan + memory boost (which shown that icici bank app is running at backend whereas a banking app never runs at backend), now the banking app is not opening. I am quite sure the developer responses is going to be please send email or some similar formality. I am sending this feedback for one more reason which I opt not to mention upfront. God bless.","So far everything about this app is amazing! 🤩🥰🥳 I'm very Impressed with this Dr. Safety app so far I haven't had any add pop up !! Now that's a really big deal to me. There's also not one thing that I haven't been able to activate without getting a subscription for first or have to pay for first. So great job goes to the person or person's that created this app. I will try it out for a week and then I'll give an updated response! 💖 AmberLeeski"],"appId":"com.trendmicro.freetmms.gmobi","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trendmicro.freetmms.gmobi&hl=en&gl=us"}
