From now on, you only need the NordVPN app with Meshnet enabled to connect to remote devices securely. Link up to 10 of your own devices and 50 devices of other NordVPN users. Meshnet is great for accessing and sharing files, playing multiplayer games, or getting some work done on shared projects!","comments":["I've had to drop from 5 to 2 stars because of a critical problem that seemed to coincide with the latest app update. When set to auto-connect / stay connected always, I'll now suddenly find I've been browsing without protection -- and that Nord has logged me out. Logging in resolves the problem, but I want protection that I don't have to constantly monitor to be sure it's on. It's NOT a setup issue, Nord's worked great for me prior to the update. Bummer, as otherwise Nord's service is solid.","Switched to Nord from Express a couple weeks ago. Not only is it hard to install on the router, it disconnects all the time (even with the desktop app) and doesn't reconnect without a full system reboot. Had Express for 3 years, paid for 2 years of Nord, still going back to Express because this experience is unbearable. If you game at all, do not use Nord VPN.","Edit: your response fails to address my issue which only reinforces my opinion. Used the service abroad. While it was ok some of the time, there was much of the time that it failed to connect. They auto billed me one day before renewal. Within 30 minutes of being billed I asked to turn off the service as I wouldn't be using the service again this month. They flat refused. Makes it far less likely that I'll use the service again. There are many to choose from. Their loss.","This works great most of the time. I have always been able to connect to wifi at work but a lot of sites are blocked for business reasons. 🙃 This app allows me to access everything with no fuss. The only gripe I have is when I'm at home with no restrictions to where I can browse then my connection gets wonky and slow sometimes. Forcing me to either restart the app or close it all together. I also noticed that with some streaming apps (phone only). They won't connect while running the app.","For at least a month it has refused to stay connected for more than a max of maybe 30min at a time. Have tried all protocols, restarting phone, clearing cache etc. Finally tried uninstalling and redownloading it this morning and now I can't log in at all. When I touch the button the app freezes and stays that way. Very annoying especially considering it used to work just fine. One extra star because I also have it on PC and that works like a dream so obviously the service is real."],"appId":"com.nordvpn.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nordvpn.android&hl=en&gl=us"}
