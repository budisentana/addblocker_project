The only reason I'm giving this browser three stars instead of two is because it's the only browser I know of that can download torrents, I didn't actually try downloading any torrents though. Anyways, it's pretty slow on most of my devices and even on the one device where it wasn't slow, it's still not the fastest browser I've used. The built in ad blocker didn't actually seem to block ads, even with the powerful ad blocker turned on. There are some sites that I tried that think this browser is outdated. Also, while I don't mind the built in video player, I noticed that, at least on some sites, it would cause an issue where if you tried to full screen the video too fast it would just show a black screen. Then I also had a device specific issue on my tablet (HP 7, running android 4.1.2), where almost every website gave me an error saying that the connection wasn't secure and it refused to let me use those sites. I didn't have this issue on any of the other three devices.","I've been using UC Browser for years and set it as a default app. I liked how the bookmarks are saved and incognito mode. I don't like every time after you update, so many ads and nonsense news show up, but somehow I managed it. That was tolerable, but now I hate it. Two biggest issues by now. I was using it to watch video, sometimes it can be so buffering. Then I tried exactly same video with Chrome, much faster. After that everytime I can't open a page with UC, I try with Chrome, open right away. The second thing happens to me is that everytime I'm trying to type on UC, the keyboard would always disappear when you just start to type 2,3 letters. It never happened with other browser. I'm thinking it's time to change my default settings.","Bogus. This was an excellent app. Now it's slow, lags while YouTube streaming (on broadband WiFi for crying out loud) but the final insult is that I cannot turn off Facebook notifications which have been greyed out. So now my phone keeps getting multiple notifications for the same item. I do not have the inclination to spend time figuring out how to disable them, that is not something that should be set as a default. Deleting app, I'm done.","This is my favorite Android browser to date. It is the quintessential app for my Galaxy Tab E. Not only is it faster than any other browser, but it has a smoother, customizable, mobile friendly interface too. It couldn't have a better set of loaded, on-board tools, including a premium ad-blocker. It took many years, but finally, somebody got it right! A+","This app is great BUT it's slow when scrolling up/down. Very janky and laggy. I also want to get rid of the annoying links that are in the homescreen of the app that you can't remove/add like google and trip advisor. It needs to have a chrome browser extension on pc that WORKS so i can sync my bookmarks on mobile and pc. I would also like a search bar in my notification menu (dolphin browser has both). I really want to like this browser. So i will keep an eye out, check in every once in awhile for any improvements. I will change my review/rating until then. Update: I had no background processes when running the app & thank you for responding so i will give you three stars :')"],"appId":"com.UCMobile.intl","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UCMobile.intl&hl=en&gl=us"}
