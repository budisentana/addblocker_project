I didn't noticed any performance issues. Also it is showing nice report, that demonstrates how many ads were removed and how much traffic was saved. Also subscription price is surprisingly affordable.","For blocking pop-up ads it's great, but, sometimes, it makes my Internet connection slow, even on other devices connected in the same hot-spot. It's a bit pain in the s to turn on and off all the time. And, its license is way toooooooo expensive for my country.","No option to allow tethering?? like your neighbour (n*tg**rd) they can add allow tethering feature. Because i always use my hotspot phone for tethering to my father & mother phones. Cmoon i believe you can add that feature. It will be the best adblcok & firewall app if you can add that option. And i will add more star if you can implemented that. And yes i know there is many vpn tethering app, i dont want to install many apps. I just want 1 simple & lite app with complete function. I'll waiting.","it doesn't work for free. I deleted it in one sec, wasting time. RE: No, not even \"to try\" option. Only \"buy subscribition\". Please anyone who dnt ready to pay take a look at another app","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!! I have bought a lifetime license and I have found that this app doesn't work as described. I have contacted to the developer for refund a few times and still haven't had any respond."],"appId":"com.consulenza.umbrellacare","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.consulenza.umbrellacare&hl=en&gl=us"}
