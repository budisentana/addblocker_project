Ad Remover was born on Windows where it was well received. Then vendor released an early version (currently v1.0) for Android devices which requires you to install and use the Firefox browser. Unfortunately this important limitation is not clearly mentioned up front, so I'm downgrading the product to only two stars. Vendor should bite the bullet and make it work on all mainstream browsers, esp. Chrome. Until then, Android support is \"coming\" but has not yet arrived.","This app works extremely well on my PCs, laptops and Firefox on my Android phone. My only issue is that on mobile devices, it ONLY works with Firefox. I wish it worked with Edge & Chrome, since these are my browsers of choice on my phone. Ad Remover works so well on my PC using Edge or Chrome, I'm not sure why they can't make it work on Android. Of all the ad blockers out there, I still recommend Ad Blocker.","Not good. Doesn't work on my Chrome Book and having problems transferring to my phone. \"Says it doesn't block ads on other apps except Firefox? But I don't use Firefox. Going to ask for refund, but don't expect much cooperation. Always the problem with some software products online. Only communicate by email and at 76 my Internet skills only recently got used to a biro and paper. Think I paid by PayPal and never had a bad experience with disputes where they involved. Sorry poor experience.","The way.it stopped SPAM ADS worked super, mostly. My problem with it was that it wouldn't let a lot of My CONTACTS, come through, sent Important calls to VM. Very important Dr. contacts that I had already called several times just could not get back through while a child was in hospital. I went through the settings over and over and could Not rectify the situation. It was very frustrating for all. The Name and # are starred & on speed dial. So now I'm getting to 2-3 junk aday.","Ad Remover has been completely unusable on my phone. It works great on my laptop with the Microsoft Edge browser, but on my phone it first required the upload of Firefox as my default browser afterwhich every time I've tried to open it, it requires install of the Add Remover Extension, but when I hit the Add Extension button all it does is take me to the last browser page I was on in Firefox. To date it has been completely impossible to use."],"appId":"net.browsetech.adremover.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.browsetech.adremover.android&hl=en&gl=us"}
