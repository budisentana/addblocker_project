No matter what i seach for all i get are blank pages. I was hoping this could be an alternative to the tor browser but no matter what i search or browse all pages are blank and do not load. Even after having paid for it to unlock some features i still can not import bookmarks or use Tor. While this is a decent minimal browser that claims security, if it can't do even the basic things it could to do for a product I'm paying for I then have a hard time trusting any of these claims.","Fraud. Tried to prevent review. Will not allow me to select english language. Everything in foreign language. No option in settings. No way to delete prior searches. Full page ads with no way to delete.","I've loaded all our family devices with this browser. Goodbye Chrome. Everything useful is loaded onto the main screen and is incredibly easy to access.","Everything is great and its pretty quick. Look forward to trying out its different features and will browse more","Can't import bookmarks. Is that a Pro only feature? I know the command is in my Settings, but it doesn't run when I select it. Otherwise it's a fast browser."],"appId":"com.nitron.mintbrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitron.mintbrowser&hl=en&gl=us"}
