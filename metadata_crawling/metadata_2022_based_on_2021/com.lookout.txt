Flagship Android got an Android 12 update earlier this year and suddenly it was choking up and doing all kinds of weird things wouldn't display images, apps would lock up, restart the phone several times a day.. then, I disabled lookout.. and everything has been back to normal ever since.. wonder why that happened but I'm keeping it turned off other than just scanning new apps and shutting it down","Horrible app, worthless customer service. I have already emailed and basically and told that they don't know what the issue is but when I log in and it says that the last time there was a location of one of my phones was the 10th of June that's 7 days everything is up to date all the permissions are there everything's turned on your program just flat out sucks it used to be great don't know why you guys had to try and fix something that wasn't broken in the first place.","I've been a paying customer since 2011, and am beginning to be disappointed in the lack of responses via email on an issue with a \"malicious link\". I've contacted the website owner and he assures me it is secure. Using Galaxy S8 phone. Other than an occasional issue with \"malicious link\" issue (happened a few years ago too) this app is great. The issue has been fixed. Thank you!","Well I can describe it in a few short words safe and secure Good looking out for me but I've been with Lookout just about every phone that I could download your app to. I've been with Sprint forever and Verizon wireless, I've been through a number of service for your cell. Now I'm with T-Mobile, so I downloaded the free app like I always had with you! I love this app it's very secure, it detects the things that are necessary to protect your cell phone, laptop whatever the case may be! E. Evans","6/20/20 It's a great app to use when it's working. Whenever I need to use it to make my daughter's phone scream because she can't find it, 9/10 times the app says it will send out the request once it regains connectivity. In the end I find the phone all by myself before this connectivity issue is resolved. Now, new phone still the same issue. My daughter went out of state and I wanted to see where she was and the app could never locate her device. Looking elsewhere. This is beyond ridiculous."],"appId":"com.lookout","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lookout&hl=en&gl=us"}
