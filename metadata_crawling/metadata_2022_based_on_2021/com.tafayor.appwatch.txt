I did a search on Play Store and found and installed AppWatch, and I have been more than happy with it!! The first time an ad popped up after I istalled it, I ran the check, and found it was a flashlight app I had installed about a year ago!! I happily deleted that app, and haven't had a pop up ad since! Highly recommend this!","I wish I could give this 20 stars!! For 2 months I've been dealing with pop up ads every time I unlocked my phone. This started after the latest Android update. I've tried all kinds of things to get rid of them. Finally heard about AppWatch and installed it. Followed the instructions and when the ad popped up I checked the app notification and it listed Photo Editor as the culprit. I uninstalled it and no more ads since! Thank you so much!!!","tryed 3 other programs to find out why my phone was freezing, and why I was getting so many pop-ups. I used appwatch and in one day , it told me what programs are running in the background, and what was not supposed to be running, and I was able to delete the programs that I thought was good, but turned out to be spying on me and causing all these ads to come in. thanks!","I only downloaded this about 6 hours ago. I've been having non-stop random popups on my phone. They've disrupted phone calls, video chats, watching videos, etc. I tried several apps that were suggested by blogs; none of them worked and were extremely confusing. Like I said, SIX hours. And it managed to help me find the app. I am so beyond grateful for this app! This is a brand new phone and it was so slow and laggy. Oh and it gives clear directions and was so simple, a caveman could do it. ;)","Perfect!!! I had annoying ads popping up at random times on my phone. I downloaded this app and was able to quickly solve the problem. Just install it, turn on the app monitoring feature, use your phone until the next time the popup happens, then go to AppWatch. You will see the trouble making app. Uninstall the bad app and your problem is solved. Note: Those who gave this app a \"1 star\" expected it to stop the ads. It does not stop them. It identifies the app that is causing them."],"appId":"com.tafayor.appwatch","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tafayor.appwatch&hl=en&gl=us"}
