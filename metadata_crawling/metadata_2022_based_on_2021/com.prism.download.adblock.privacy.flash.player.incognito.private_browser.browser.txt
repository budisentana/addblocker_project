However, this was not a satisfactory experience. Some sites did not seem to navigate properly. Inability to access settings to clear cache, cookies, etc. in incognito mode was not extremely convenient. Erasing all text typed in the address bar upon clicking outside of it (even accidentally!) is grating. Whenever I switched to my security app to boost and scan, the page I had left would be erased upon return. This browser was good in theory, but ultimately unusable with its current issues.","I'm not an IT guy but went about looking for cracks that might expose the hidden files and couldn't find any. I typed in a password, opted not to save it to google, it didn't show up on any other sites that require a sign in. Exiting a web site is easy, on left side of screen swipe from left to right, shows what pages are open, tap on X to exit. Excellent App! Update: Noticed on history all the right commands are there it's though they just don't work. The code must be missing.","I really love this app!! Its very exceptional to my experience on micro-managing. It really helps on being discreet and to the point. I wouldn't use any other source besides the private browser. Nothing against other reliable resources just that this one fits me... I highly recommend u to try the private browser at least once. It is fast and to the point. Very easy to use and helpful to the mind knowing that you are incognito! Private Browser - Incognito is the way to the free throw. Smooth sail","There are lots of great things about this browser. I love that the bookmarks are organized alphabetically and that bookmarks can be the homepage. However, the app has not been updated in almost a year and it needs to be. Please allow more than 30 bookmarks, since this really limits the usability of the browser. Also, the app crashes whenever you click on a link that opens a new tab.","It is a good fast browser. It has a simple interface and to the point. I like it because I just need to browse safely without creating much of digital footprints and tracks. I am not looking for tons of features, just clean clutter free privacy browser. This does the job."],"appId":"com.prism.download.adblock.privacy.flash.player.incognito.private_browser.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prism.download.adblock.privacy.flash.player.incognito.private_browser.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
