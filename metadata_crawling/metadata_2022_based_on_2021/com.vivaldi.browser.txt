Browser options like themes and layout choices help you make Vivaldi your own.\n\nPersonalized Speed Dial \n\nBrowse faster by adding your favorite bookmarks as Speed Dials on the new tab page, to keep them one tap away. Sort them into folders, pick from a bunch of layout options, and make it your own. You can also switch Search Engines on the fly using Search Engine Nicknames while typing in Vivaldi‚Äôs Address Field (like \"\"d\"\" for DuckDuckGo or \"\"w\"\" for Wikipedia).\n\nTab Bar with Two-Level Tab Stacks \n\nVivaldi is the world‚Äôs first browser on Android to introduce two rows of mobile browser tabs. Long-press the New Tab button & select ‚ÄúNew Tab Stack‚Äù to check it out! Choose between using a Tab Bar (which works great on larger screens and tablets) or a Tab Switcher to manage tabs. In the Tab Switcher you can quickly swipe to find open or private tabs and tabs you‚Äôve recently closed in the browser or have opened on another device. \n\nGenuine Privacy and Security \n\nVivaldi doesn‚Äôt track your behavior.

I started using Vivaldi right after they split from Opera. It was good when they first started on their own, but since then, they have truly become the best. More features than all rivals, even desktop browsers, and a sync system that is there to help you, not help sell you ads. Try it, but be prepared to switch to it full time. You'll be hooked fast, but switching is simple and quick. Browser wars have a winner","For my model phone, this browser works as fast and as reliable as Google Chrome. The Vivaldi user interface sets this browser far above Chrome. The speed dial is fantastic, even though it requires a copy and paste to add an entry. Maybe a future update will make it easier to add a website directly to the speed dial. There are many excellent features yet to explore and I hope this will become my permanent go to browser. Highly recommended to try on your phone and specific operating system.","I'd say UI wise it's definitely the best browser I could find. Very polished. But the animations, especially when you click the address bar to type in a url is extremely slow. I also think back/forward button could be implemented in the bottow address bar, there is space for it. One feature I'd like to have is \"disable autoplay\" in site settings like firefox and \"disable google AMP (aka the cancer of the internet)\" like Kiwi.","Scrollable or Continuous Tab Stacks triggers a bug when enabled. Whenever you completely close out of Vivaldi the app will never open again, just keeps crashing. Clearing cache does nothing, nor restarting my phone. Clearing Vivaldi app data is the only solution. I have some flags enabled, but w/o fail as soon as those scrollable tab-related ones are enabled, the app crashes. I've isolated it through testing, having had to reset (newest version) Vivaldi about 7x in last few days.","The bottom toolbar is excellent although I think Opera has better UI icons. The ad blocking is nice although some pop-ups still plague some sites. Speed Dial could use a visual overhaul to be more like Opera and an \"add to speed dial\" option for web pages. The privacy features are quite good. Best mobile bookmarking hands down. It's an excellent browser but it's main issue is speed and bugs. Speed this browser up and I'll give it another star. Simplify the drop down menu from the top."],"appId":"com.vivaldi.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vivaldi.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
