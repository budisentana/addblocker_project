We have been working on bug fixing and improving performance to give you a better experience.<br><br>More changes:<br>- Added a suggestion strip when you tap on the search box in homepage.","comments":["It's a safe and private browser but lacks DDG and Brave search. Liked fast browsing, bottom bar, full-screen options for YouTube and pop-up window but add background player like Brave browser and playback pitch speed. I don't know Vietnamese language so why forced news (can't disable it) and notifications in that language? Most importantly, please bring import and export bookmarks and passwords option and dark theme for websites. Do check Kiwi browser for import export & Opera browser for dark.","Very good browser. The only annoying thing about this browser is the news on the homepage (can't get rid of the news) . Please provide an option to disable the news section in the next update.","Good Day sir what a beautiful app and That's why I'm Giving it a fullðŸŒŸRating I hope it will gain a high Lvl in popularity/success.1 Day..ik it can happen if its what.You.Really.Want but if Lazy it just wont happen at all cuz working hard is the way plz add background audio playback+TV Mode/app+mapping actions with a TV remote Launching urls-switching tabs-Going Back / forth is nice+ built in Lock we all just obvi need privacy all of this can happen as you=Judge/jurry/god of such a Great app","It doesnt let me choose folder to save download. The only two options are internal & sd card. Please add feature to let me choose different folders for saving.","This is a very good browser! I have tried before many applications for downloadin videos - IDM in all shapes and colors, but none of them can download videos as well as Coc browser! This thing just tears them apart! However, there are a couple of things that really bother me. Firstly, there are those Vietnamese news cards at the bottom of home page (unfortunately, you can not get rid of them). Secondly, while playing a video in fullscreen mode, there are no onscreen buttons for adjusting volume."],"appId":"com.coccoc.trinhduyet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coccoc.trinhduyet&hl=en&gl=us"}
