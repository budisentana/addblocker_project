I searched the options, and haven't been able to find any new controls or settings. Nothing in the release notes indicates any changes in ad serving for Opera.","I've been using Opera for PC and the regular android version for about 2 yrs. I've even convinced several friends to switch over. I just bought a new android tablet and because it's a bit slow on memory I thought I would try Opera Mini. Unfortunately it doesn't feel nearly as streamlined. There's no back/forward buttons in tablet mode, and the UI back button only switches tabs rather than taking me back to my previous page. Also the lack of a \"true\" dark theme kinda sucks. Needs some work!","was my favorite until the last set of updates over these past 2 weeks. add blocking is fine. but extreme data savings mode changes make it nearly unuseable. if i click on links in the website, something else launches. i wish it would roll back 3 weeks. High data saves but not as much as extreme which doesnt really work correctly now. otherwise great app","Opera Mini has a lot features. Page saving, download etc. But it does have flaws. Every time videos are downloaded \"file is missing\" appears and the video has to be downloaded again. Further \"file already exists\" repeatedly appears. Check the flaws.","It works as expected! I presume that there be little improvement in how the contents are being displayed by the app! However, thanks for the level it on right now but you just need to keep improving the app with respect to the contents."],"appId":"com.opera.mini.native.beta","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.mini.native.beta&hl=en&gl=us"}
