So I tried switching to a browser without ads. I think I have make the right choice as this browser is almost as good as if browser. Thanks a lot developers. A small request: when i am going to download any files I am not able to see the file size before it is being downloaded. Plz fix this.","I download a movie and after some time Download disappeared. It shows no downloaded file and no downloading file, then where that file went. Worst experience totally disappointed. No choice left. UC BROWSER is best. I thought to use indian browser but in vain.","good app,i suggest devs to make youtube bg player while browser is in background mode,more stable network and security...while trying to delete history manually it doesn't work,on other side while on exit browser ask you to delete it,from this step it works but manually it doesn't so i am dissapointed but doesn't mean i don't like it. I like it so far so good really need development work on this if you wanna do a sucess.","Ok pretty good indian browser but need to upgarde a lot. Heres some points: 1. When i search in thw field of home page, when the google search results open it shows some code-words and in the search field link is written, not the searched term 2. Need vpn option 3. Do own video player and upgrade it without buffering 4. Do a smooth transmission effects like opening tabs, searching etc 5. Do tab list view, that was in uc , extremely helpful also the plus/add tab does not work always"],"appId":"com.browser.yo.indian","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.browser.yo.indian&hl=en&gl=us"}
