Please update your OS if you want to keep getting updates for our app.","comments":["The previous update broke the app in such a way that it rarely worked. Luckily the new update has fixed that issue and other underlying ones. Still wonky to use, but worth it to avoid the ads that plague everyday life. Edit, April 25 2020. Upon further use, I have noticed that it has almost completely stopped blocking ads in most cases, which is highly disappointing. I am reducing the score to 1 star until they make it so the app actually does as advertised.","Unsolicited pop up ads were driving me crazy! They would pop up every couple of minutes disrupting games, stopping streaming and videos, interfering with everything I tried. My virus protection couldn't find any problem. I even tried other antivirus programs. Nothing. Then I started using other ad blocking apps. Some were partially sucessful, until I downloaded Adblock. For the first time in weeks I can use my tablet/computer without unwelcome interference. Thank you!","Works ok, but when it comes to YouTube there seems to be a few problems. First, the loading time is longer, which I understand that is because of the amount of ads, but is it really ok that it took like 30 secs to go to the next song? No. Secondly, YouTube then started to act strange. First, half of the screen was taken up by a white bar, which would sometimes change position, go fullscreen for no reason, and then YouTube would completely black out. Please fix, this is kinda annoying","This app was great for about 6 months. Now it doesn't work at all. Every website I go to I'm bombarded with ads. The quick settings of the app show that it's not blocking any ads when I have everything set to block. Even resetting the ap doesn't work. I don't know if this is because of a recent update as my aps update automatically. But this is unusable for me until it is fixed. Very disappointed.","I used to use your other app which worked fine until it forcebly upgraded to this, losing all my settings and bookmarks in the process (thanks for that by the way). The worst part is it shows even more ads than before now. Even though I have disabled unintrusove ads, I still see them. The only reason Im still on this is the other adblock browsers dont seem to work either. Edit: It seems Brave is a good browser for actually blocking ads. I just recently switched to that and am quite happy."],"appId":"org.adblockplus.browser.beta","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adblockplus.browser.beta&hl=en&gl=us"}
