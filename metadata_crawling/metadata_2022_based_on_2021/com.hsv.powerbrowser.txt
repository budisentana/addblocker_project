Please give us the option of returning to before the update. Also, this business of grouping tabs on mobile.... come on. That is about as useful as a hat to hold your drinks with straws coming down into your mouth. If you wanted to improve the experience, maybe let people be able to drag a tab in the stack (in the previous playing card way) into another positions, that could be actually useful. I used to praise the interface, but if this does't get fixed a workaround offered I'm quitting my subscription. Also, another tip that your dev team could be working on that would improve things: allow for the adjustment of the borders in reader mode. Reader mode is great, but I wish there were a way to increase the black space (dark mode of course) at the sides of the text.","So far so good! I only just installed it, but it is responding very well. I went through about 9 or 10 search engines one at a time, installed them, tried a few things, found problems, uninstalled them & moved on to another until I tried this one. We will see how it stands up over time, I'm hoping this will be the one I keep. I previously had one (I will not name it, but it had a 4.7 rating!) that I used for 6 weeks, it was ok at 1st until I noticed glitches that caused other problems. 😵","Update: initial review was about how as I opened the app for the first time I got hit with the offer to pay for advanced mode without any description whatsoever about what advanced mode was. To this day I still don't know what \"advanced mode\" was. Instead my issue now is every. single. time I open this app it downloads. What, I don't know. It's downloading. And then it asks you if you want to want to pay either a monthly or a yearly fee (free still available). Every. Single. Time. Nope. I'm out.","I had this browser as my default browser but I am sick and tired of the new development of having to jump through hoops every single time I open it before getting access to it. I will be seeking a new default browser.","Doesn't work now since new update. Im getting Pop-ups like crazy now. Freezes and crashes. Un installed and re installed cleared the cache. Nothing works. This app is totally useless now."],"appId":"com.hsv.powerbrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hsv.powerbrowser&hl=en&gl=us"}
