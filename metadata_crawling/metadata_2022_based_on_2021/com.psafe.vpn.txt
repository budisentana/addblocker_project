So far I am truly impressed at the number of features and that these features are truly important. As not yet able to do a complete check, it appears the features in the upgraded plan r working & reports given are comforting. Again, haven't had chance 2 check completely 2 confirm all that's being reported is actually so! So far, so good. Thank you","Since the last update this app has not work correctly. I have uninstalled 4 times and checked my wifi and it still doesn't give me the pop-up notification when you open a web browser or email also it is preventing my email downloading graphics and pictures and you cannot open links from within email. Even though it does shows the precious key on the notification bar at the top of the phone screen. And customers service does not help. It worked great till the last update.","Update May 19 2020 Check out VPN PRIVATE. One little single screen ad that you can easily close, no data caps, 21 locations throughout the world, great connenction speed, secure, and you want to what their best feature of all is? It is 100% free...Once I realized that you only offer 200mb of data daily, I had to uninstall. There is no way I will pay for something that I can get completely free with more locations with no data caps from a better app.","This app seems really nice. Ive had it for a couple hours. I uninstalled this app, because it wants me to give it permission to automatically factory data reset my phone, as well as erase all my data, WITHOUT WARNING! So, just a heads up; READ THE STUFF YOU DOWNLOAD PEOPLE. If something seems to good to be true, well... It usually is not true.","I like it but it interferes with what I'm doing too much and it wants to take up too much of my time when I have several things I need to do without having to worry about arguing with the security program and having to push buttons over and over to get back on track you need to work on that because it's really overwhelming and it makes you want to shut it off but I like it it's got good features and it does a good job"],"appId":"com.psafe.vpn","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psafe.vpn&hl=en&gl=us"}
