So much so that it was affecting the broadband connection to the tv (wired router/modem combo, set-top box). I tried everything (resetting the modem, changing channels...), but the bandwidth still was crappy. After some Googling, I started deleting the cache from the apps on my phone, and switched to this app for privacy. Since then, the bandwidth has greatly improved, and the video feed to the tv stopped freezing up. My findings are that the pictures, video,and such needed for searches and browsing was bottle-necking. All of this was done yesterday (10/5/2018). If anything changes, I will update my comments. Keep up the good work!","I've been using this app. for well over a year, and I've not had any issues with pop ups, or my browsing history causing spam emails. I will update if anything changes, but I would recommend giving this app. a try. It is updated quite frequently by the developers, which I really appreciate. As a matter of fact, I just received an update this morning to further enhance the pop up blocker, and \"incognito\" mode. I applaud the developers for continuing to provide frequent updates.","Im always skeptical about what products claim to do, but after reading many of the great reviews, along with the bad...I went ahead and tried this and have definitely noticed less ads than before. It's not perfect at blocking everything, but it's doing one helluva job at keeping things at bay.","It could run a bit faster and smoother and maybe the option to decide if you want your searches saved only because the page I was on for lost when my WiFi lost signal and the app started over. But other than that the app is perfect so far. And I haven't had any spam calls from every state in the country wanting my credit card yet today so thats a plus. Hope this app keeps up the good work. Some apps start out good but become lame so maybe this one will finally work out. We will see...","Seems to work good at blocking ads but app gives me too many notifications and when you click on it, it doesn't even take you to what the notification says, it just takes you to the usual home page. Also constantly gives me notification to close all incognito tabs. I think it just pushes this notification everytime you use the browser and so then I have to close that notification everytime after using the browser."],"appId":"com.hsv.privatebrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hsv.privatebrowser&hl=en&gl=us"}
