Besides, we’ve fixed different bugs and minor flaws, and updated a VPN client. Note that AdGuard VPN v2.1 for Android supports devices with OS version 7.0 and higher. ","comments":["This product is not something you should pay for. On my device it constantly disconnects and does not reconnect until i do it manually. On windows 10 it is very slow and the app keeps crashing and trying to recover option pops up and then nothing happens, alot of the time the server i connect to is offline. i only bought a 5 year subscription because i use their ad block product which is great so i figured they would not release something that is this bad. Maybe it will be better in the future (can't really be worse).","I really want to like this, but the VPN connection drops nearly daily with no warning and no notification that it's been disconnected. I'm using Adguard ad-blocker as well (in compatibility mode, which is a great feature). But with Adguard VPN, I've tried the kill switch function (\"always on\") to combat the random disconnects, but Adguard ad-blocker won't operate in that mode. Frustrating. Otherwise, speeds are great and UI is solid.","Needs the option to auto-reconnect when network becomes available. Currently the only setting is to connect on boot. I commute through areas with no reception and I have to keep manually reconnecting after getting service again. Windscribe, IP Vanish, and others have the auto reconnect option and no issues. The only reason I switched is because I use your ad blocker too. Please implement this basic feature that most every other VPN app has.","Used daily for 6 months. Constant disconnections and outages- literally every day I have to either manually disconnect and reconnect to a different server or I find out that I've just been disconnected for an unknown amount of time. Literally no reason to use it at this point since the adblocker component doesn't work on a Pixel. Big waste of $35.","Been using adguard products for awhile. I have the ad block on all my devices. I only use the VPN on my android phone. While it works well with adblock. It needs some work, it needs a connection timer a few times it didn't connect and I thought it was on. Be able to many save locations. Tell me my ip address I'm connected to. Sometimes it won't disconnect I have to kill the app. I have it so it won't go to sleep on the battery optimization.
