Also maybe have the option to keep all tabs visible like on a computer because I have switching between tabs but other than that it's perfect!","I've been browsing around for better internet tools and this one is definitely in my top 3! It's all-in-one is super convenient and I love how easy with just a flick I can jump around search engines. I definitely recommend this app to anyone looking for something easy to navigate for all your browser and search engine tools. It's a keeper in my book!","This browser is just one of eight browsers i run on my phone. I research heavily into many aspects of life and one browser with countless open tabs is sloppy to me, so i decided to have numerous browsers with a few tabs open. I have them listed in a Browser folder in order of favorites. This is my third favorite browser but number one in looks and design. This browser is beautiful but what holds it back is when you're on a web page and try and scroll back up it thinks you want to refresh the page. That on top of not having a video detector downloader is why this browser doesn't have the number 1 and 2 spots but nonetheless it is beautiful and fun to use.","Like the Facebook app, this browser continues to run after you naively thought you closed it. Edit/reply to dev: It didn't just lie dormant in memory. It was actively running in some fashion. I realized this when I noticed an icon in my notification bar that I hadn't seen before. It belonged to Smart Search. We close most apps expecting them to do nothing, whether or not they reside in memory. Of course, apps like sms and email, etc. need to run even after they're closed. Where am i wrong?","I have used this app for awhile now, and am constantly impressed with it. I think I have tried almost all the other browsers out there including Samsung they sort of work, but have found they are invasive and are not very good at keeping up. UI is great and I love the fact I can customize the browser settings to fit my needs. the ad blocker works so well that I to remember to turn it off sometimes to get to some websites that I use. Great job with this one. Thank you."],"appId":"reactivephone.msearch","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=reactivephone.msearch&hl=en&gl=us"}
