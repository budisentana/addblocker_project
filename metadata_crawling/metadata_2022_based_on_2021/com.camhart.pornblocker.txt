Here's what I think: 1. Doesn't affect battery life. 2. Premium Membership offered but isn't slammed into your face so no annoying nonstop notifications of premium membership. 3. The filter works very good & doesn't slow internet connection at all. 4. I'd highly recommend this to anyone because this does what it says it does and the free porn filter works great.","Great app. It does exactly what it says it does and I've been using it for weeks with no issues. Unfortunately I had to drop a star due to the new update that forces you to give it your email address for no worthwhile reason. Edit: minor issue fixed, this is literally the best app available for keeping you away from the darker aspects of tech. It's also one of the few block apps that closes the app instantly which is very important. If I could give this ten stars I would.","Just switched from iPhone to Andriod and was surprised that content restriction was not built in Android already. After searching and testing around lots of different Android apps, I finally found Truple apps. It gets the job done and I'm glad to see that it's free, and I am willing to pay the premium so it's not so easy to uninstall and to also support the developer's work.   I was also able to communicate with Cam (the developer) when I had issues with setting things up and he was super responsive. It was a nice feeling to know that there was a human behind the email and that he really cared about what he was making. Cheers up, Cam!","The filter is excellent. I've been using the basic version for a while and finally upgraded. Worth it. The basic filter works well but is fairly simple to bypass, with the upgrade any attempt to bypass the filter that I've tried (testing) immediately redirects to the Truple app. Well done.","I think this is a good free app, for what it's designed to do. It does a excellent job of blocking out porn and sexual content, based on the words you type in your search. A downside for many people might be that disabling the app is so easy. I personally don't have an a problem with that. Excellent free app, for blocking out the most inappropriate content!"],"appId":"com.camhart.pornblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.camhart.pornblocker&hl=en&gl=us"}
