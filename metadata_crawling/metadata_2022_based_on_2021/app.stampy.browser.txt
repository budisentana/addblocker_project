Any update for this? And when I open the app, it doesn't show three dots to change settings until I search something.","All I can say is if I try downloading any page your app still takes longer to load than other browsers. And why is it such a big App? What does it do? If I load a new page, it just sits there waiting for me to open the keyboard? I don't want to look at an elephant outline! Also= Like a lot of people want a definite close app tab. Like Opera, of which the fully loaded version is still smaller than your, What. Portal to bing? I want this app to succeed. Early days yet it seems. TBC Good luck","Failed to block any ads. I compared it to the plain Google and Firefox browsers, and it showed the same ads. The adblock browser Brave did not display the ads. Stampy seems to be based on Firefox, Brave on the Google browser. Looking forward to more development on Stampy, keep trying.","I find Stampy good for Fast navigation due its ad blocking features and also for blocking javascript I would recommend for people who search for simple and fast private browsing Simple yet effective but minimal thank you devs","AMAZING This is a great app. You guys did a great job. The best ad blocking app out there. That is my honest opinion. And people reading this. This is not a fake review. It is real. And try this app. Before you call it off. Thank you developers. You deserve more users. (Advertise more is my suggestion)"],"appId":"app.stampy.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.stampy.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
