The more that I use it I'm really wondering if it's a modified version of the kiwi browser, now that it's went open source the code is available to use. I'll keep using it for now & continue to evaluate it. I've already discovered something that I don't like, site's on the home page can't be changed/deleted.","Like the app for the most part, except it will not open to the desired home page. Even though I have the homepage setting turned on. I want it to open a specific page, every time I open the app. If I want to go back to my last visited page every time, I would just use Chrome. Sadly will have to look for another browser....... Yet again.","This is a great little browser. But I don't want to read news articles from the BBC or CNN all of which are just regurgitated fake news stories. I also didn't like that the ads were mixed in those so sometimes you would accidentally click on those.","Another good replacement for the now useless firefox browser. Actually faster and streams better than the old firefox. Am comparing Cobalt to Midori, another 5 star browser, at present. One downside for both is no save as PDF functionality, but can be overcome with add-on from playstore.","Nice. Good. But at the end of the day pretty much just a fork of kiwi. My only REAL problem that's on your guys end is the annoying \"most visited\" and \"suggested sites\" shortcuts/links/PROMOTED *cough cough sellout* CONTENT on the otherwise beautiful and sleek new tab page"],"appId":"com.cobalt.app.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cobalt.app.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
