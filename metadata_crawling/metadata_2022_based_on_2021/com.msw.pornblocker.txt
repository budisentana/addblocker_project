However I'm currently on the 7 days trial and not sure of I'd actually make the purchase to keep this application on the phones because it can be Uninstalled without asking for a password. I also noticed that the application turns off at some point and I have to log on to enable it again. My last concern is if I turn my phone off or restart it will turn the app off also.","The app would be easily a 5 star except no help with problems. Email several times with no response. Just needed password sent. Administrator can't get Emails anymore. Couldn't get updates with settings, no help.","I've used this app for a couple years and have loved it, never had any problems with it. But unfortunately the app now no longer takes my card, and there's nothing wrong with my card. I can't figure out why. I would love to keep using the app but it doesn't even allow me to pay for it.","Very useless app. I first subscribed for a yearly basis but was forced to cancel my plan because the filter would simply not work. Moreover when I tried to get a password via Email to log back in, as I had initially entered a random hard to remember password, it would still not work. Please fix these glitches and don't advertise your product in a manner that it is not. Thanks","It works great when it's on, but every couple of days I have to reset it's accessibility settings on my phone, which I have turned on previously, to get back to it's total functionality. Don't know why/how it turns off automatically. Please help me solve this issue or fix the bug if their is any related to this."],"appId":"com.msw.pornblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.msw.pornblocker&hl=en&gl=us"}
