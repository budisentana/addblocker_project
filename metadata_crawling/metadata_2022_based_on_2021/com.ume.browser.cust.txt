Now my phone has gone crazy. I'll be talking on the phone and it randomly calls someone else. I'll hear the ringing to the call I wasn't making and the person I'm speaking to. Deletes stuff and random text messages. device is buzzing when not active and device light blinks when no notifications appear. How can u get rid of this app? It's not on my device apps but it's on my Google play apps. I didn't install it and I can't remove it. It says update or o","This is a built-in browser for my android phone and it's a total piece of sh•t!!! Never had this browser activated on my phone until I got tired of google's criminal ad abuse with their chrome browser, so I enabled, updated and activated this browser and at first, it was paradise— literally bliss, it comes with AdBlock, so there was no ads, and it was lightning fast— but NOW, I can't load a single page without at least half a dozen ads assaulting me and it is slow as molasses!!! NOT RECOMMENDED!","Why is this called an ad blocker? I tried two other ad blocker browser apps, and they work fine. This is worse than a normal browser. It is like the wild west when i use this app. I have ads everywhere màking it hard to read articles, pop ups and redirects firing at me. Its not secure. It tried to download ad click malware and it popped up \"I won a prize scams\" hoping i would click it and download malware. I would suggest staying far away from this one.","I have researched hundreds of browsers searching for a lite browser with stable reliability and recently downloaded Ume Browser. I've seen it on here before but never gave it a try because of poor reviews. After further research I learned you can't trust reviews on the Play Store because 75 percent of them are false. So I gave it a try. Ume is the best browser and has no false or copied data. You've done an incredible job Mr. Developer. This is the best quality of work I've ever seen. I love it."],"appId":"com.ume.browser.cust","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ume.browser.cust&hl=en&gl=us"}
