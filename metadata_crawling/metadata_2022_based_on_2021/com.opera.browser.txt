Pages loaded quickly, easy to swipe away tabs when done, most pages rendered fine. Was my android daily driver. Then they started adding paid sites (ads) to the speed dial page. It annoyed me, but I would delete them and that would be that. Now they've added an entire sponsored section with 5 sites (ads) to the speed dial page. You can't change or delete it or the icons. Have grudgingly returned to a competitor and will now delete the app.","The MAJOR problem with this browser is that you can't use \"select all\" to copy the screen text. Place your finger on the screen and you'll discover that the \"select all\" option doesn't even exist! You MUST address this problem! Here's the developer's lame response, \"...we're sorry for the inconvenience. We're constantly looking to provide the best user experience for our customers and really grateful to receive such feedbacks. Best, Kateryna - The Opera Team (8-28-21) STILL NOT FIXED!!!","Lately more and more websites give access errors when using this browser. Use it in incognito, no issues. Use Chrome or Firefox is regular mode, no issues. It seems to be sites with logins, like the Harley Davidson site and New York state tax portal. I don't know what info you're trying to get from these sites when I'm logged in, but it's clearly not something they want you accessing. Not the best when your browser is trying to access things it shouldn't. Guess it's time to switch browsers.","Recently switched from chrome to opera on all my devices and can't see myself going back in the near future. Lots of features make the app really nice and easy to use. You can do a lot more than you can with chrome. You can also link your account and access all your dial up shortcuts from one device on any other device. I don't have enough characters in this google review to really describe how much stuff this app has over chrome. I wouldn't trust this app's privacy features to protect you alone","Speed Dial is great. I like the toolbar on the bottom but Vivaldi does it better. I want all of the security and privacy features of Brave in Opera and this is the biggest selling point. The Opera UI is super clean looking and is the best looking of any browser. Kind of middle of the pack speedwise. The ad blocking is OK and pop ups show up almost everywhere so eliminate that. I'd like to access bookmarks from the bottom toolbar with a button next to the home button. The app icon is ugly."],"appId":"com.opera.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
