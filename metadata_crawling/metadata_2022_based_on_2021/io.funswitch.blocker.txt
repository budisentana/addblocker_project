I turned on the accessibility and now it just glitches. The glitching issue has resolved and I'm happily able to use the app again. It's a pretty good app. More proactive communication from the developer if an issue is noticed would be the only enhancement I would recommend.","This app is great and has a lot of good features for someone like me. I like the way the app is organized and welcoming, it makes it seem like im not alone. I do however wish the \"block me\" widget could be overlayed over certain screens. I would like to have it over my browser just in case it gets to that point of no return. Idk if that's a premium feature or something tho. Great app anyway!!","It's a great app! Very easy to navigate. The social platform needs some work. It looks messy and unorganized. But can appreciate the efforts you have put into this community! The resources avaliable are also growing. Few suggested improvements: 1. Social platform needs better organization 2. Please let us know whenever you do a major update. I noticed that the blocker gets deactivated whenever there is an update. 3. Computer application is inconsistent.","It works well, and I'm glad it's available, but there's one big problem for me: it randomly changes settings. For example, on YouTube I have to disable captions for every single video (I've tried every setting) and it gets really annoying. Also, if I'm trying to report something (a comment/post) as containing inappropriate material, it prevents me from doing that and kicks me out of the app.","UPDATE Um...I was wrong...after a few days of frustrations and back and forth these guys did it and made some amazing improvements. Especially with the keyword block and blocking on YouTube. Nice job! ORIGINAL REVIEW I had to return my phone to factory settings and I reinstalled the Blocker X and now it is not working as expected. It ignores my blacklisted words. It also will stop working at a moment's notice. Not worth it."],"appId":"io.funswitch.blocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.funswitch.blocker&hl=en&gl=us"}
