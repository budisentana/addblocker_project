The design is perfect including quick access on home page, a forward arrow and the best url bar. Not only can you change the color of the background but also the brightness in dark mode. I agree with what many others have said that is why X is my default browser!","Great browser with many customization and gesture options, as well as nice UI. Also, it does not seem to hog battery. Reader mode is nice with adjustable font sizes and background colors. But it does not show full text on many web sites, which limits its usefulness. Another problem is that the browser store passwords on some sites but not on others. Other than these 2 problems this browser is a winner.","I really enjoy using this app. My suggestions: update the list of user-agent strings/add more options to interface, disable swiping to go back ans forth by default (quite annoying for a new user who does know which setting is causing it), allow users to hold search suggestions to copy them to the search bar for faster use (similar to autofill), and finally, when a site loads into Google cache, the page refreshes from the tiniest scroll down - very frustrating. Otherwise, fantastic app!","Really like except 2 things. 1st and most important: even after history is cleared, the \"open closed tab\" feature in the gesture setting can open closed tabs all the way back to at least installation (clearing cache and data also does not eliminate previously viewed websites from beong reopened by the reopen gesture. Incognito does not prevent this.). 2nd, lacks option to not show window xontent when not the active app.","Very good browser, good in-built adblocker that really works! Browser is fast, & updated regularly! Browser is very light on memory, lots of great features with this browser! Adblock ing ability is top notch, especially with the ability to mark specific ads to be blocked in the future ðŸ˜€ There is also the ability to whitelist sites, so they don't get blocked. Developer has done an excellent job with this browser, & any issues are fixed very quickly, with an update. Browser is highly recommended!"],"appId":"com.xbrowser.play","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xbrowser.play&hl=en&gl=us"}
