Then I updated to a Galaxy S8 Plus and ran into a major problem. I discovered that I could no longer download images such as jpegs to my gallery. When I checked the download pathway it came up in red, and the message said \"red denotes invalid pathway\". I tried other browsers, and they designated the same download pathway, and I was able to download images to the gallery with no problem. The only browser that doesn't work is Dee.","works as intended, but I do have a problem with crashes that lose my tabs, especially if I try to pull up a game with the browser running in the background. it has gotten better fairly recently, but it is still an on going problem.","At long last, an ad blocker that works. The browser is excellent and blocks all pop ups and ads. I have tried others, but this one reallly works. Look no further.","Tried Firefox for android. Too complicated, loaded with useless apps. Dee is fast, simple to use and understand. Built in ad blocker excellent.","Dear Developer, Why from the past few Dee Browser's Incognito mode not working. Tried all the things to resolve the problem but it still exists. Please solve the problem as soon as you can.
