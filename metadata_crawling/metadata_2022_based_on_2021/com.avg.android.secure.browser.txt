Whenever I download something, the item goes to a hidden media vault that is difficult to access. I have had trouble with this for the last 2 days! Then when I find what I am looking for, the vault will not let me save to another location. I am going to start using another browser (not AVG) for downloading!","For whatever reason this app takes more time to load any single page than it would take the entire sloth species to develop a modern society and fly to Mars. I think I sprouted a grey hair looking at that loading bar move 1 pixel per eon. Meanwhile firefox, chrome, and the YouTube app I was trying to replace with this to avoid the ads, the one thing I got this app to do, seem to run at a crisp lightening pace.","As far as the browser itself goes, I love it! It gives me flexibility to set things up the way I want them, not the way Google or whoever wants them to be. So far AVG has made me feel very secure with all of their helpful tools, not just the browser. The ads, on the other hand, which you get stuck with if you can't afford to buy their premium packages, are filthy pics of half naked women and scams for everything you can think of, so don't assume the ads are safe just cause AVG's software is.","Pretty good internet browser. Found my Chrome, Firefox, and Samsung bookmarks. Does not play well with Google and has an annoying \"This browser is not the default browser, Click Here\" button on its home screen. Also, does not have an option to select another home screen. I have been using it to increase my confidence level. UPDATE: Found a way to select a home page which helps (and which improves it over Firefox which requires a sign in a sync delay prior to being able to customize the home page. Found that I needed to delete all cookies, cache files, etc. a couple of days after using it to prevent slowdown. I have been wondering about add-ons and other tweaks to improve my personal experience.","So far this browser blows away Firefox. Trying to use a secure browser as rock solid as the Tor Network without having to use the Tor Network. This is most definitely the closest browser I have found. It has the search features of Google and the security features of Samsung. It's a underrated browser. Pay the $9 a year, it's a no brainer. VPN, Custom Modes, etc. No need for adding plugs and or extensions when they are already part of the browser? You just need to arrange it the way you want it."],"appId":"com.avg.android.secure.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avg.android.secure.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
