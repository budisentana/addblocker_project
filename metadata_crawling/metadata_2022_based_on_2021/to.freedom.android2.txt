I use freedom across about 7 devices. Time lags in blocking schedule is usual. Sometimes it allows me to access websites that is supposed to be blocked. The app may fall asleep so often and turning battery optimization off doesn't promise that he works. However it's the only app in the market that is useful. Better than nothing though it's far from perfect.","Seems to be the best option available. I like it a lot. However, when blocking messaging apps you can still reply from the drop-down window for some reason. Also, for the truly addicted, I wish there was something to discourage me from just uninstalling the app or turning off the phone to end a session. Maybe something like discarding all your settings or forcing a password reset if you decide to uninstall. And if you decide to restart your phone, the session should start up immediately again.","I am not sure why the app only have 2.9 stars. It might be that the app itself might need some getting used to. The service and the app itself, to me, are awesome and life changing. I used many services and apps to block distracting sites and apps, but none of them wasn't really good. With Freedom, I get a single place in which I can create and mange all of my distracting sites and apps and initiate a block session, that works across all devices (couple of laptops, couple of phones, etc.). This is a great service and app, highly recommended to anyone who struggle with keeping focus and maintain concentration.","Works as expected on Windows, but the Android app still needs work. For example, it lacks completeness in that it only works for Chrome, where my primary browser is Firefox. It's also buggy: going to a blocked website creates a new tab with the message that you're being blocked, but leaves the original tab the same. Having properly synced and working PC and Android apps was a major reason I got this app, so I'm a bit disappointed, but still getting something of value out of it.","So far so good. If you pay for the app, you can't turn off a \"session\" while it's running, and you can schedule these sessions to recurr. The scheduling could definitely be better. There is only a start and end, and it's all apps in blocklist or nothing. It feels pretty clumsy, as i can't eg schedule breaks to allow YouTube during lunchtime, or schedule everything on just one session. Maybe they should hire me and we can work out how to make the app flexible."],"appId":"to.freedom.android2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=to.freedom.android2&hl=en&gl=us"}
