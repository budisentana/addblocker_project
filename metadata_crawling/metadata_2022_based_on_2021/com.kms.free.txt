I must say I am completely satisfied with the protection it offers and assured that my devices won't be compromised. Simple to use, does what it's supposed to do, no annoying pop-up ads and i highly recommend it over several other security-related apps I've tried. Kaspersky Works so why not try it today.","The app continually looks at my device for threats with a minimum amount of input from me. Just the way I like it! Contains a mostly standard amount of ads promoting the paid version, but I guess they have to keep the lights on somehow. Overall, a pretty great suit for my mobile and desktop device needs.","This program does its job very well. This program does not go too far and totally take over the whole device. So far after 2 years it seems to be exceptionally on time and prompt preventing destructive viruses etc from creating damage. I'm happy with it for now. The main thing I dislike with all apps is advertising and minimal advertising I tolerate but when it gets to a certain point I just delete the app or program no matter how good it is.","One thing I do not appreciate with security apps is when they prevent you from adjusting their own permissions. I've just noticed that Kaspersky prevents you from changing any system level permissions in their app. In a sense, Kaspersky is acting like a virus by not allowing the administrator of the device to change anything, or even disable the service either permanently or temporarily without installing the app. I am now reconsidering using this app.","This app wored on and off during the free trial. What I didn't like about it was the fact that's it wouldn't stay continuously connected and protecting my phone at random times? That left me vulnerable to all sorts of intrusions. I had to continuously double check my settings so I just uninstalled it. No matter free trial or not it should erform at it's very best level to impress me and protect me! Better luck to those who have had no troubles with their experience. I believe swiss protection"],"appId":"com.kms.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kms.free&hl=en&gl=us"}
