I only loaded two websites and when I tried to load a third webpage a massive advert loaded instead of my page saying that I had to clean up urgently my mobile phone and couldn't load anything at all after that and if that wasn't bad enough it then takes you straight to the play store to download and install a clean up app. Wants destroying and wiping down from the whole of the internet and every single appstore known man.","It's ok for watching center videos, but so many pages and sites that it says no longer exists. Funny I can always with a different browser. This one needs some work yet. But nice try and there's no private browsing options.","Very FAST, and easy to use. It very clean and basic. But I'm wondering why it has a adblocker, but there is a ad on the very bottom of my screen. But this is one really good browser.","Missing desktop mode. Loading speed is tremendously sluggish. Can't sign in to Gmail / YouTube in incognito mode. Scrolling lags & freezes when streaming YouTube videos.","Blazing web browser is really good, fast and secure for everyone and also really good ad blocking system including. You really feel ads free exeprience."],"appId":"com.sahani2020.blaze","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sahani2020.blaze&hl=en&gl=us"}
