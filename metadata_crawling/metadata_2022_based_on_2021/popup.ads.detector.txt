Improved process of uninstalling apps.","comments":["This is a great app. I was so defeated when popup ads started plaguing my phone. Couldn't identify the source. This app identified the offender immediately and I uninstalled it forthwith. The cool feature is that the floating Popup Ad Detector icon is replaced by the icon of other apps when they are activated. I noticed the Samsung Wallet app icon was appearing regularly, even though I never opened it. Seemed sketchy, so I uninstalled it as well just to be safe. Really like Popup Ad Detector.","After a few days of trying to methodically uninstall apps that I thought could be causing horrible full screen pop-up ads on my phone, this app was able to find which one it was quickly and easily. My goodness, thank you, it was driving me insane. I honestly don't know if I would have found it on my own since it was an app I had paid to have the ads removed from and wouldn't have suspected as the culprit.","All I can say is...WOW! It really does work! For the past week, my android has been bombarded with constant pop-up ads. My phone battery drains within an hour from full charge and I can hear video advertisements playing in the background during phone calls, causing other applications to force close. I found the Popup Ad Detector and immediately after installation, the annoying popups were gone! After trying everything else in the Google Play store, I finally fixed it and I'm so grateful!","I don't usually write reviews for apps either but I just gave them their $5 for this app. It saved me in the middle of the night last night. I have an old tablet hanging on the wall as my clock & alarm. Suddenly in the middle of the night ads started popping up and playing annoying music loudly. I had no idea where it was coming from because the only running apps I had were paid (no ad versions). I found this app and installed it and in minutes found what app was doing the ads. Turned out to be a hacked/fake version of a legitimate app. I uninstalled it and the ads stopped and I went back to bed. Thank you!","Awesome app! Really helpful to see where an ad originated from, especially when it started to happen as soon as I got on my phone no matter what I was doing. All different ads, some repeats, but the final straw for me was an ad playing in my ear while I was talking to my son from work! I had to stop some notifications from various apps, but I believe Google Play Store was the culprit. Very surprising. But no more ads without having to do a factory reset. I am grateful to your developers."],"appId":"popup.ads.detector","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=popup.ads.detector&hl=en&gl=us"}
