Best browser so far. I have used chrome, Microsoft edge and Firefox and this is the best browser hands down. I love the gesture navigation. Edge used to have it but removed it so I switched.I have switched from chrome due to annoying changes. I really like the gestures swipe navigations and all the other features and the Picture in picture. If it wasn't for LG I would of not know about this. Awesome!!","This is the best browser for the dual screen LG G & V series phones. Love how it can utilize both screens and has some handy features to efficiently utilize the two screens like double clicking a link to have it displayed on the secondary screen. What would be nice is if there was a separate search field on the 2nd screen to allow for a secondary browsing functionality. Only item keeping this from being perfect is that it doesn't work with my LastPass password manager. Hope it's fixed soon.","I used to use Whale when it came out, recently came back to it and it's improved a lot. Theme is very clean and modern. Seems easier to use. Like the lock browser option so I don't have to clear history to share phone with someone to prevent snooping. Very innovative feature.","Great on my LG V60 Dual Screen.... But is this app at all optimized for the Microsoft Duo 2? I would love to carry over this app to my new phone but when I explore the app I do not see any of the dual screen options/behavior on my Microsoft Duo 2 that I experienced in my LG V60. Can anyone please help? I love the app on my last phone and want to utilize the dual screen functionality on my new phone. Please help. Thank you.","It's UI is very handy. But sometimes it do not load pages. I think this happens because it cannot handle multiple tabs.This browser takes me to Youtube app instead of opening YouTube in the browser app. But I don't want to browse youtube in youtube app. How can I browse youtube in this browser app?"],"appId":"com.naver.whale","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naver.whale&hl=en&gl=us"}
