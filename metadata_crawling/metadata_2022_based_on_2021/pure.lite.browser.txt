Was using Via for a long time until I just got fed up with the way it acted after recent updates. Switched to Pure Browser to try it out and I'm pleasantly surprised so far! It's faster and more reliable for me, and it even downloaded a few videos from social media that I wanted to have to refer back to later. Developers, don't change a thing! And if you do, only change it for the better. Will update my review as time goes on.","This is one of the better browsers I've encountered, having both the ability to save webpages and the ability to change the search engine without having to go into the options menu. Its only issue so far is that the search options, while easy to change, are somewhat limited (and I have yet to find any way to add to them) and that the program seems to ignore changes to download path, as my saved pages are still appearing in the default folder rather than the folder I changed it to in settings.","My #1 browser so far. Recommend it to everyone I meet. File size is pretty good. The ad blocker does actually work exceptionally well, the best available today. The video detecting is also top notch and downloading is easy. The only problem I seem to have, is every so often it seems to not bring up a web page after going back into browser after leaving it. I have to force stop and then reopen it. This does not happen often enough for it not to be my #1 browser though.","\"I'm trying to create a separate home page and keeps telling me: There is not enough space on the screen\". Edit: Still getting note on empty screen but i found the icons elswhere. OK, i can live with that. But i think most of us would be really happy if somehow we could pick/adjust the colors of the icons instead of just getting random colors. I have to do it a lot of times each to get the color that blends in (barely) with my home screen icon pack. If you add that function it would be perfect!","BEST BROWSER!! I have tried 10+ browsers trying to get the proper ad-blocking capabilities as well as fast browsing speeds. This app does not disappoint. It actually makes the internet experience better. Pages load lightning fast and ads/pop-ups are hidden from view entirely. Very impressed! -I would love the option for a black background in the themes section as well as the toolbar menus. I have vision issues and this would help me out a lot. Thanks devs!"],"appId":"pure.lite.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pure.lite.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
