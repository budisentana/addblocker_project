Not loaded with clickbait and other pushed garbage, but you will need to spend some time playing with settings to get what you want. Ad blockers and private tabs of course. Not heavy resource user. UPDATE 01-23-22: Removed a star. I'm beginning to see pop-up ads. UPDATE 6-16-22.. So slow I switched to different default browser. Why does this always happen?","Excellent! The only one that could solve the conversion of web page to pdf in a perfect way, I tried about 100 browsers and none of them solved as it should be, some have the option but they don't work correctly! If that is with that option, what will it be with everything else? Thanks a lot!","I've been looking for new browser & video downloader and this one fits my needs pretty well. It lets you download to a custom directory and you can view/modify downloaded files in other file managers. The only inconvenience is there's no download shortcut nor any way to add a download icon to the navigation bar. As such, it takes two clicks before you can get to a video picker where you can choose what to download, the process needs to be less clicks but it's not a deal breaker at the moment.","I love the app. It is a very fast browser. However, one feature I would love to see is that on startup, my tabs won't be restored. I can do this this if I press the exit button but it would be more convenient if can just swipe the app away and not see any previous tabs when I start the app back up. Other browsers like Brave can currently do this. Other than that, stargon is an excellent browser!","Finally a mobile browser I can just flick my finger to go back or go forward on webpages. The negative is sometimes certain web pages don't load, but if i put the address into Chrome, it works, so the page was working. Also, it'll be nice to have an easier way to toggle incognito mode.
