It is stable, so far for me bug free, and if you get used to it and then have to use Edge or Chrome at work, it will drive you crazy because you get used to sites being add free, loading faster, and being less distracting. I wish this was the default browser for OS systems. I also wish it came with a TOR plugin built into it, and if it did, it would be close to perfect.","I really like this web browser. Fast and reliable without the ad's. I don't have to worry about everything i look up and seeing it in some ad or come up in later searches before even typing. but if im being honest... I mostly use it for youtube and enjoy being able to watch all the video's i want commercial free! my only complaint is i can't customize the background outside choosing light or dark.","My favorite browser. Very fast and you can use chrome apps. EDIT: I unfortunately have to dock a star. Every so often the app will become unusable without having to reinstall. The search bar would crash the app without fail. This has happened over multiple versions of brave on multiple devices and it seems to be a fairly common issue.","Pretty good browser. When I'm searching up cooking recipes, it allows me to avoid those pop up ads. Whichs means I don't have to dance around the screen, clicking the tiny tiny X that might not even cancel the pop-up but open a new window instead. There are few more good points but, I'm watching youtube. Priorities, right?","Needs bookmarks more organized and accessible like a grid or something where you can easily see and access all of them since they are so vital to a web browser. From their homepage, only 3 random ones are visible. Can only get to bookmarks through multiple menu clicks. Not very efficient. What a mess. Needs option for address bar, etc. to be on the bottom for easier accessibility. Needs option for custom homepage."],"appId":"com.brave.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
