Same awesome ad blocker with a new super look.<br>‚öôÔ∏è Stability improvements and bug fixes.","comments":["It worked for a couple years, but suddenly stopped blocking the ads. I checked for updates, redownloaded the ad blocker, and redownloaded the internet browser I use. Still failing to block all the video ads. It worked good up until then. I would suggest trying a different ad blocker until they release an update that fixes this issue.","A lot of other reviews say it doesn't work with other browsers and give 1 star. This is designed specifically for Samsung Internet and when turned on works extremely well removing adverts and trackers that bog down browsing. It has also been updated a few times recently so feels optimized too.","Consumers looking for a serious, working adblocker should avoid this app: It does NOT support \"file path navigation\" to a custom filter list, from the phone's storage. Locating & selecting a file's \"Details\" displays it's path(s). Attempting to put this path in ABP's Custom Filter List dialog box - gives \"Error adding custom file list\"! The devs intentionally broke \"auto-path select\" (like those in mp3 player apps) - to prevent ease of use, nor let users add custom filters from phone storage.","Sometimes I wonder what Google bases it's 3 \"Tell us more\" questions (underneath the stars for your rating) on, 'cos frequently I find it couldn't possibly be related to the app I'm trying to rate. Does this app look good visually? I mean, \"yes\"? Cos it does a great job of letting me browse nearly hassle-free, and since I've never literally seen an ad-block app doing any of its good work, I'm gonna go ahead and call that \"good visually\" üòé","I don't know if it's just me but it isn't blocking pop up ads as good as it used too? I would be reading something and ads would pop up in a new tab and it never happened before."],"appId":"org.adblockplus.adblockplussbrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adblockplus.adblockplussbrowser&hl=en&gl=us"}
