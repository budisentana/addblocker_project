Settings.","comments":["One of my most dependable and daily used app. Recently it fixed a lot of bugs I was experiencing so I'm satisfied but I wish it would go back to rotating to landscape whenever I toggle Fullscreen while playing a video. I love the weather card but I wish it was in a better position where I don't need to swipe to see all the information. Also I would request to not slap me with a Russian page when clicking on the weather card. Also, can you please fix google translate extension not installing?","The Best Browser For Smart TVs By Far. It's not even close, Yandex is the only full browser i'm found for a smart tv. If you install Chrome/Firefox or anything else, you get a tiny phone version of their browser. Yandex offers bookmarks, shortcuts, full Media ability. It's offers twice what any other browser. Almost zero crashing either, unlike the constant crashing of other TV Browsers. It's made in Russia, which made me nervous. But i haven't noticed any sketchy stuff yet and i've used it for 6+ months. Good job to Yandex Devs.","This is better than the original and beta versions, especially cause of being able to continue playing videos immediately while leaving the app to something else. I.e it doesn't require one to go full screen first. This would definitely be the best Android browser if it offered dark mode when viewing articles. Come on Yandex! You're holding me back from making this my system default browser.","Already one the best browsers in the entire store. Speed, navigation and acessibility are all great. The only real(as of early 2022) downside is the lack of options regarding extensions, otherwise this browser would be number 1. Update: nevermind the extension thing. You can install all chrome extensions, so dark reader and no script, both a must for me, work perfectly.","Used this for two years with a Huawei. I was very happy with it especially the translation option. After 2 years I have quite a few bookmarks. Now, after a March 2002 update they are inaccesable. I can scroll over about a dozen and then the app hangs. I appreciate this is an alpha release app but this prob. needs fixing if it is going to continue to be any use at all."],"appId":"com.yandex.browser.alpha","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yandex.browser.alpha&hl=en&gl=us"}
