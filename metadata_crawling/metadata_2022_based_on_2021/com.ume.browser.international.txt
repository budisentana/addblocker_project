Keep up, it is good handling for me.","Always loved this browser and on my Alcatel one touch it was the default browser preinstalled but is very harmful to your device now and full of spyware and adware and seems to have the opportunity to access your contacts and text messages from the very first time you install it even if you haven't ever opened the app and appears to always be running in the background up to god only knows.","Everytime I update the the latest version, after it updates, it refuses to allow me to download anything to my device through the browser. The browser also loads too slowly in general, and while i like the cosmetic improvement to the latest version, the browser is confusing to use.","Sorry don't like your new redesigned homepage.","Not satistified with latest update"],"appId":"com.ume.browser.international","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ume.browser.international&hl=en&gl=us"}
