The premium (which all these timer apps have) is the cheapest premium I've seen, that being only 6 dollars and a one time fee. All these other apps have you paying a monthly subscription and some apps have their monthly fee at 10 dollars! This one is definitely best app because of the cheap premium and ways to stop you from going in to settings.","I had an issue with restoring the premium version of the app when I recently got a new phone. It turns out I had logged into the wrong account that was used to pay for the premium version, then deleted the app and then reinstalled it and it was restored. The developers were patient and cooperative to assist me with this issue, as I really enjoy using this app to help boost my productivity.","Pretty effective and doesn't affect battery life nearly as much as the last app I tried. One large problem is that when using the 'take a break' feature, the block screen comes up when pulling up the recent apps screen. This has been a problem for months. The usage stats page also bugs out pretty frequently, mostly when switching days or changing from daily view to weekly view.","I really like this app because it allows you to set it to block apps after using them x mins per hour. All the other apps only did minutes per day. The biggest issue I have with it is that if I make changes to a schedule because i want to use an app longer, it will still block the app even if it shouldn't be based on the new changes.","Nice clean, straightforward functionality. Does almost everything that I wanted. Worth the upgrade. Areas to improve: - app timer does not reset each day. For example, if I set \"after 30 minutes, take a break\" the 30 minute timer will start with the remaining minutes from the previous day (so I might only get 5 minutes before activation the next morning) - \"block keywords\" fuction does not work for Asian character sets."],"appId":"com.stayfocused","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stayfocused&hl=en&gl=us"}
