Thank you for the response. I use the full version and love the app. I wish the app startup was faster like the lite. I changed the rating, thank you again for reaching out to your users.","My original review had 5 stars, but since the recent june 2021 update, the overall look of this app has taken a huge step backwards. All the bookmarks I had saved on speed dial are now in another menu, speed dial only shows a few of them and you have to go into a second menu and scroll to find the one you want, there isn't even a search option and no way to undo this change either. There's also no ad blocker, which is crazy for a modern browser. I've switched to vivaldi.","Its ok. But a function missing I cannot get over is the fact there is no \"desktop view\" so the user always has to browse from a mobile view experience and a lot of the time it is a limiting factor. Not a deal breaker but there really neeeds to be an option to change the user agent at the absolute minimum!","ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE ! For monthes i was hoping you guys would fix it but its still the same, till this very day it doesn't work here in the UAE , it worked fine monthes ago, the app still keeps telling me that there is no connection while im 100% connected to the WiFi and most certainly open the VPN, same issues as always wether it's the Original or the Lite version , they both share the same issues that hasn't been fixed till now, it was so helpful and reliable for me to reach out other websites and help me with Skype calls , now it's useless ! Beyond dissaponting","Under my testing but so far, trending search needs to be removed because its a cluttered option that few will use. Front page needs to be user configured for personal use. Options for News, etc. needs to be removed as its not needed in a browser. Just adds BLOAT. Enough news apps to cover that and bookmarks if you have a need. Dont know who though browsers needed this option built in. They dont. Testing paket & VPN security. More later.
