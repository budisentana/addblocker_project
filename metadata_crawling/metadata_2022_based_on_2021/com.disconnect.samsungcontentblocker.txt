If you are looking for the version that blocks all ads on your phone, it is disconnect Pro and it is about $25. You can only download it off of the galaxy store, but I use it and all ads are not running on my phone. Definitely worth the money as it avoids having to buy the pro versions of all your other apps with annoying ads.","It... works. It kept redirecting me to the wrong browser (I use Samsung Internet Beta, and it redirects me to Samsung Internet), but it works regardless. The redirect to the donation page every single time I open the app is really annoying, though. It should just be its own button, like everything else.","Requires a $20 & up \"donation\" to use the product before you even see what it does. It does say they will give you a full refund if you dont like the product, but I'm not willing to lose $20, or more of they dont keep their word. If you choose the \"use for free\" option it doesnt give you protection, so it's basically taking up space.","After testing several ad blockers, several times, my results showed only 4 ads blocked while others blocked as many as 38 ON THE SAME TEST PAGE. I am now uninstalling. These are terrible results from an app that carries the Samsung name.","NOT A FREE APP. They want a \"donation\" (aka payment) of 15 $ or more, and it doesn't show until the last step of your registration when you sign up. To make it even worse, there's still pop up ads showing. Uninstalled. ( Samsung galaxy note 10)"],"appId":"com.disconnect.samsungcontentblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disconnect.samsungcontentblocker&hl=en&gl=us"}
