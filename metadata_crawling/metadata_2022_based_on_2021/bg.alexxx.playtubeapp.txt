Was not worth purchasing. It does not mute the ads, and I still have to deal with the youtube video pausing feature. I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling, to no effectiveness.","Best app in the world, even after not blocking the ads but it does a great job of skipping ad, you can also mute ad but I don't wanna mute soooooo I turn it off yeh TURN IT OFF it is Custom it's the best thing and you can press volume up and down for shortcut the best app in the world !!!!!!DOWNLOAD NOWWWWW!!!!!!","It's a great app and all but it also enables the 'x' button problem. So you can avoid ads by muting and skipping them but you can't avoid the 'x' problem. Can't go a day without annoying your customers/users one way or the other.","it's a really good and useful app, works perfectly without issues although minimizing the video while an ad is playing does glitch the audio a bit and if you unsubscribe from a channel with this app on it will undo it, other than that it's a really good and useful app I would happily recommend to anybody","It was nice while it worked. The trial ran out and I decided it would be worth the $2 to keep the app, but after paying the app still said my trial was expired and never worked. Got Google to refund me. The developer should make a separate premium version with no restrictions since they can't figure out IAP's."],"appId":"bg.alexxx.playtubeapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bg.alexxx.playtubeapp&hl=en&gl=us"}
