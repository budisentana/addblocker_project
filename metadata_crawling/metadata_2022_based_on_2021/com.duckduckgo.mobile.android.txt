{"title":"DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser","description":"Tired of being tracked online? We can help. \n\nDuckDuckGo is the all-in-one privacy app that helps protect your online activities. With one download you get a new everyday browser that offers seamless protections from third-party trackers while you search and browse, and even access to tracking protection when receiving email and using other apps on your device. With DuckDuckGo, privacy can be your default.\n\nSearch Privately — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in so you can search the web without being tracked. \n\nBlock Tracking Cookies — prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\nEscape Website Tracking —Tracker Radar automatically blocks most hidden 3rd-party tracking scripts lurking on websites you visit in DuckDuckGo, which stops the companies behind those trackers from collecting and selling your data. See notes and links below for more information.\n\nEnforce Encryption — Smarter Encryption forces many sites you visit in DuckDuckGo to use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes. \n\nBlock Email Trackers (Beta) — 70% of emails track you as soon as you open them. Enabling Email Protection is the easy way to block most email trackers and hide your address without switching services. Join the private waitlist for the free beta version through the app settings menu. \n\nProtect Your Privacy in Other Apps (Beta) — Block most hidden app trackers in other apps day or night and prevent third-party companies from invading your privacy with App Tracking Protection. See notes and links below for more information. Join the private waitlist for the free beta version through the app settings menu.\n\nThe DuckDuckGo app has the browsing features you expect, like tabs and bookmarks, plus privacy controls you’ll love. Taking control of your privacy doesn't have to mean making tradeoffs. \n\nTap Fire Button, Burn Data — Clear your tabs and browsing data with one tap of the Fire Button. \n\nSignal Your Privacy Preference with GPC — Built into the app, Global Privacy Control (GPC) intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities with one app. It's privacy, simplified.   \n\nNote about our tracker blocking for 3rd-party sites, emails, and apps:\nDuckDuckGo never tracks you. When you leave our search engine to use other sites and apps, we aim to block as many hidden trackers as possible, but we can't block them all for a few reasons. New trackers emerge all the time, so first we need to find them. Then, blocking these trackers can sometimes break functionality, so we need to develop new approaches without hurting usability. Additionally, in our app we offer a specific type of protection that stops scripts from even loading on 3rd-party sites, which isn’t offered on most popular browsers by default. Currently, this one loading protection doesn't apply to Microsoft scripts on 3rd-party sites due to contractual restrictions. However, our other tracker blocking methods (like 3rd-party cookie blocking) are unrestricted and continue to work against these trackers to protect your privacy online.\n\nAbout Us: https://duckduckgo.com/about \nHow It Works: https://duckduckgo.com/app \nPrivacy Newsletter: https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter \nPrivacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy \nOpen Source: https://github.com/duckduckgo/android","descriptionHTML":"Tired of being tracked online?

In turn, I've increased my rating to 5-Stars. This is perfect for browsing around the net without having to worry about what's left behind. I use other browsers when I need to log into important password protected sites that have settings I prefer save, and DuckDuckGo for everything else!","There are not many search engines, currently, that block intruders, trying to follow you, and also fireproof where you have been, without having to download, or apply extensions to original app! I have tried several, but this app allowed me to search without any complications! Its easy, fast, and with a push of a button, your invisible! Thanks, Duckduck.go!","The DuckDuckGo app seemed good at first, but after using it a few days it's apparent it is extremely buggy. I've submitted multiple detailed feedback reports, and have doubts that the bugs will be corrected. One example: Audio streams repeatedly stop only minutes to seconds after initiating the play/'playback'. It's useless for things such as audio, and other things; so much so that I've had to return to using other browsers for certain things.","A great browser for the most part. It sometimes provides unique results that Google doesn't even show. Unlike Google I can tell I'm not being tracked. I'm not getting pop ups / adds for things I've looked up, and my searches are not being bottlenecked either. However ddg suffers from a lack of results, and also doesn't remember user settings. You are requiried to enter, and save a custom profile ID to enter in each time before use which is clunky.","Overall, I love this app. I like that it protects my data and that the ads are unobtrusive, and I like the customization that it allows so far (e.g. dark theme, changing the icon, changing the fire button animation). To get five stars from me, it would also provide settings to customize what the fire button does. For example, I'd appreciate a setting to make it delete all the data (e.g. cookies, etc) but not close my tabs. I would also like to be able to move my tabs around to reorder them."],"appId":"com.duckduckgo.mobile.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&hl=en&gl=us"}
