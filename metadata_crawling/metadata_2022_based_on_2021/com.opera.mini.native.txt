I was seeing an increasing number of ads, so I turned off the acceptable ads feature. But I continue to see ads. :-( == Liking it so far. It would be great to have a button near the bottom of the screen on the the homepage that would allow you to close all tabs immediately without the extra steps that are needed now. Also News would be greatly improved if I could add my own sources. I would love it and use it all the time then.","I do not have notifications turned on. I get a full page, blank, Google ad often when I tried to open a page. It goes to an ad instead of the requested page. I have to ose that and reopen the page. Once again, I am dealing with slow service, for which I pay per minute, and this wastes my time, and money. Opera Mini also asked me to restart to update the other day while I was using it. I have auto updates turned off. I wondered why your app was so slow that day. Firefox was faster with ads.","The latest version has some issues. No top-tab, tablet mode!?! So inefficient opening, closing, and switching tabs now! >.< Ad block can suddenly stop working, letting ads appear. The browser has crashed and closed randomly 3-4 times during the past month, which never occurred with the last major version (the one with tabs up top). Otherwise, generally working smooth.","Updates have helped with response time significantly once the system is started. Ad blocking is essential and when turned on it works well! This is an older tablet and it is great to find a browser that works at all. The system still regularly crashes. Almost all videos other than utube do not work. Thanks for the changes.","Opera mini is such a great browser with such a great feature that makes it stand above the rest; its compression feature that helps save you on your data is amazing. However, the ads are really getting annoying and Opera mini didnt have them for a long time. Its a shame, since I'd give it a higher score if it wasn't for the ads. Therefore, I rate it at 3 stars, slightly above average overall. In the end, I'd consider another browser."],"appId":"com.opera.mini.native","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.mini.native&hl=en&gl=us"}
