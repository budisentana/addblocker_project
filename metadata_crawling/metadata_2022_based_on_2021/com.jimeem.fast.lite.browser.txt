But it has gotten slower and slower over time. There are no options to clear History and clear Cache, so I'm unable to speed it up from my end.","This browser seems to be working very well. Am very happy to find a lite browser that is not full of preinstalled news. Is there a way to switch to black background?","I have retained this browser primarily because it doesn't throw news trash at you mandatorily, like many other browsers do. And so, I have kicked out quite a few fatboys like Edge, Opera etc etc. Keep it this way, lean and mean. Our mugs are not designated 'news trash' repositories","This app isn't just awesome, but it's amazingly fast. I really want to make it my default browser because it's the only browser I use on my phone. How do I have that done? If I want to open a link on facebook I'm told browser not installed. What should I do?","My mobile space is very limited, thats why I have chosen Secure Browser. I wanted to view my Facebook and see YouTube videos which is achieved without any problems."],"appId":"com.jimeem.fast.lite.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jimeem.fast.lite.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
