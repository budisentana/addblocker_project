But, it gets annoying that the settings are so limited when there are issues like being sent to the home screen upon launching the app (and closing the tab you were on/going back a few pages from where you left it), no real room to customize much inside the browser (like the layout of the buttons, sliding options, etc.), and it just gets to you to a point of rarely using the browser.","Been using cake for years on two different phones, I think it's a very efficient way to flip through multiple sites and sources for just about anything you need. However, as a long time user, I finally updated to the latest version, and noticed it's no longer running with my preferred search engine (Google Chrome). After a few sudden crashes, I uninstalled then reinstalled, only to realize during setup that I can no longer pick a preferred search engine. How do I fix/reinstate this?","Not being able to edit a homepage other than what is offered is ridiculous. It's just a cluttered mess of video pics. I want to just to chiose my homepage. No home button to go straight to Google or something like that. The desktop version of YouTube shown is not the desktop version, as it doesn't display the same icons such as the notification Bell. Never had this happen with brave or Samsung internet or even Chrome. Does have some nice features but the ruined by the layout of the home page.","This browser makes searching so much more enjoyable.. and it saves a remarkable amount of time and effort by having the searched pages loaded before swiping to them. I've asked them to incorporate a few tweaks to make it even more powerful for searchaholics like me.. I don't know if they were thinking about it or if they added it because I suggested it but now, the find in page function works amazingly well.. once you set text in the find in page and go next page it opens at that text!! Super","The app has a great concept and I love the interface. I love the swiping from page to page, the customizability... I would rate it higher if it ran smoother. Compared to what came with my phone (Chrome), it's pretty slow. Total dealbreaker for me when the app stops responding to your scrolling gesture for a split second, every five seconds. Continuously. If they work out the response time and latency issues, I will be happy to come back and re-evaluate my rating."],"appId":"com.cake.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cake.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
