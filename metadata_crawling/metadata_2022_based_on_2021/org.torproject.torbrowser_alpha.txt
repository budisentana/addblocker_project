This release includes critical security improvements. Please read the release notes for more information about what changed in this version. https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-115a13","comments":["I love the desktop version, but there are a few problems (although minor) that I have with this mobile version. First, when I change my home page, it reverts to about:tor after I restart the app. I imagine this is a quick fix, so it's not too big of a problem. The second problem is that the network speed on the mobile version seems to be even slower than the desktop version. Finally, I have a quick suggestion: I think the browser should have a built in QR code reader for secure link sharing.","Very good program, no problems establishing and maintaining a connection to the Tor Network and accessing restricted websites.  There are a few small bugs:  -I wish there was an option in the settings to automatically connect to the Tor Network when the application is started, instead of requiring the user manually click the onion-shaped \"START\" button. I only launch this app on my device when I intend to connect to the Tor Network, it would make sense to connect-on-launch.  -There is an option in the settings the user can uncheck to disable Always-On Notifications, but the option does not seem to work.  -The \"save file\" or \"save image as\" options on webpages does not work. Maybe the application is saving the images somewhere deep in the applications folder, I don't know. But there is nothing in the standard downloads folder in Android, this is inconvenient for most users.  Overall though this application does the job, and does it much more smoothly that having to use Orbot and Orfox separately.","It works well, except for one thing: I often get rejected on YouTube with an \"unusual traffic\" message. I wish the browser would check YT connectivity before assigning an exit point. This error sometimes happens repeatedly, and the only cure is to close the browser, restart it, and hope that you get an exit point that YouTube (Google) \"likes\". Also, it would be nice if you could specify the country for the exit point as well.","Hello World! I'm not sure what the difference is between this and the regular browser. They are both made by the same project so maybe I should dig in a bit to find out the differences as I haven't noticed any. Overall, the app works great and keeps you hidden from those nasty trackers. Runs pretty snappy, no issues to date. Great job Tor Project! Keep it going!","I love this app, but ever since I updated it this last time, it glitches out about 3 seconds after I try to connect to the Tor network, the furthest i have gotten it to connect to Tor since then before it stops is 10% bootstraped. I hope that this can be resolved because I would very much like to be able to get back to using this as my browser, as it is by far, my favorite option for a browser that is secure and has been stable up until this last update."],"appId":"org.torproject.torbrowser_alpha","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.torbrowser_alpha&hl=en&gl=us"}
