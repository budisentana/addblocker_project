Thanks for the introduction again. Love üòç ‚ù§Ô∏è it. Would be even better not that I'm complaining but that as soon as you open spotify, the settings are done instead of having to force stop everything, it does suck up the battery, but I don't mind as long as I get to listen to my list. Thank you!, üòâ","So nice. Spotify's gotten to the point where there's an ad every two songs, and I don't always have the chance to swipe the app away. This has saved me from the heart attacks of going from a calm song to a screaming ad. Doesn't block the \"watch this short video\" when you switch playlists but that's to be expected, considering it only wanted device broadcast status and not my password. The only issue is it doesn't work with one of my speakers, but I think that's a hardware thing, not app issue.","So far this app is working perfectly! I saw a video on YouTube (Howtomen or something like that) and I thought \"There is no way it's going to work.\" Turn on/off the settings they recommend, and you are good to go! Good on headphones, phone speaker AND bluetooth (Craftsman boombox). I believe that the way it operates best is to just turn the app on and then Spotify automatically opens. The guy that developed Mutify deserves a big üëçs up. I sure hope they don't figure out how to block it...","Mostly works, but it has some issues with muting ads while your phone is locked. Edit: I didn't set it up correctly before and it seems to be working now. Edit 2: I don't know if this is possible, but it would be really nice if prompts to listen to an ad to get 30 minutes ad-free weren't muted, or even better if they were automatically activated.","Omg, I can't believe it works. At first I was like, this isn't working, but you have to turn off crossover in spotify so that there isn't any lag in mutifying. Ha! Love the name. My only suggestion, single suggestion, would be if instead of going on total silent mute, mutify could kick in and play a song of my choice while I wait for spotify's ad to finally go away. Once the ad is gone, the mutify song stops & spotify songs continue. Excellent app."],"appId":"live.teekamsuthar.mutify","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.teekamsuthar.mutify&hl=en&gl=us"}
