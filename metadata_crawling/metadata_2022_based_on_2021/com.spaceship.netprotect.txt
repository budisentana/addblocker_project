I did get lost in the beginning though because the small button to turn it on isn't really noticeable, so hopefully they can fix that. Otherwise, cool beans! Really makes a difference! The premium version's cost is a good deal, too!","I was having a major problem with pop up ads.. They were using up alot of my data. I finally went to the Google store, and searched for \"ad blockers\". Tried a couple, but you had to use their browsers. I deleted them, and tried this one, because it claimed to work with all browsers. Best move I could've ever made. I can do anything, and NO ADVERTISING!!","Blocks ads very well; connectivity problems. This blocks more ads than some of the other dedicated browsers I've used, but I constantly have to disconnect and reconnect when I change networks (walk between access points, am out of access of wifi and have to use mobile, etc). It often will just not load pages, giving me a DSN error. I realize that may just be a part of the VPN experience for mobile, but it's really annoying.","Running smoothly. I thought it would be more difficult to get it synced with the two browsers ( chrome and Samsung ) but it seemed just fine. A little brief in the content and navigation of app but that seems to be the norm with these privacy apps. It's got one job to do and by the looks of it it's doing it's job üëå Shocked though this was one of the only ad/ tracking blocker that was an add-on for common mobile browsers, all the rest seem to be private browsers with these extra functions.","I liked it because it blocks realtor dotcom shouty commercials. I don't like it because everytime I turn it off, it turns itself back on. I have the VPN auto-connect turned off. If there were a way to control it (turn off and on at MY will) I'd give it 5 stars. It works thoroughly, but seems to interferes with things I'm voluntarily trying to link to through a site."],"appId":"com.spaceship.netprotect","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spaceship.netprotect&hl=en&gl=us"}
