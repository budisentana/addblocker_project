{"title":"Lightning Browser - Web Browser","description":"Lightning is a simple, fast web browser that focuses on design, security, and efficiency. It uses material design, doesn't track you, give you lots of options to protect your privacy. It gets out of the way of the user. I built this browser because I wanted something better.\n\n● Ad blocking - Blocking ads is a core feature of Lightning Browser, meant to improve the speed and security of your browsing experience.\n\n● Design - Lightning's interface was carefully crafted so you can browse as efficiently as possible. Tabs and Bookmarks are all tucked neatly away in side drawers, only a swipe away, allowing maximum screen viewing with minimal interference from the browser's chrome. Dark Mode, Light Mode, Color Mode, Night Mode... Anyway, whatever you like, there's a mode for you.\n\n● Speed - By utilizing the WebKit rendering engine that comes built into your Android device, Lightning can ensure a swift, lightweight experience.\n\n● Privacy - Use Incognito Mode to browse without leaving a footprint, download Orbot and turn on TOR proxy support to mask your identify and location, use StartPage or DuckDuckGo for your search engine, or disable settings that you think leave you at risk. Whatever your concern, Lightning will try to help.\n\n● Features - Full-screen, check. Inverted Rendering, check. All the search engines you want, check. Search Suggestions, Bookmarks, History, User Agents, Reading Mode, whatever you need, Lightning does it.\n\n● Open-source - Just as Android open-source, so is Lightning. I believe that the best software is built when communities come together to engineer the best solution. Head over to the repository on GitHub to contribute or translate.\n\n● Free - Check out the paid version for AdBlock and Unlimited Tabs. Free version is limited to ten tabs open at a time.\n\nPermissions\n● permission.INTERNET: Needed to access the internet for browsing\n● permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Needed for downloading files and backing up data\n● permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Needed for downloading files and restoring data\n● permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION: Needed for sites that want your location (you can deny location access)\n● permission.CAMERA: Used for WebRTC - disabled by default\n● permission.RECORD_AUDIO: Used for WebRTC - disabled by default\n\nTalk to me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RestainoAnthony\n\nFork me on GitHub: https://github.com/anthonycr/Lightning-Browser\n\nBecome a beta tester: https://plus.google.com/communities/108746004608718111703","descriptionHTML":"Lightning is a simple, fast web browser that focuses on design, security, and efficiency.

It very much needs to be updated. It's simple and easy to use. Has some security options that other minimalist browsers seem to lack. It would be nice to have a whitelist for sites so that, for example, cookies from sites you trust will not be deleted if you clear the cookies.","Best and fastest mobile browser I've used. There's a bug where entering text into the address bar is not supported once you enter a period. Taps on the keyboard end up clicking whatever is on the page under it instead. Please fix this, it is the only thing keeping this from fully replacing my other browsers.","Lightning is my new default browser for my Android TV box but the free version does not have ad-blocking. Unlike Chrome and most Android browsers, Lightning page navigation is mouse-friendly. Lightning's extra mouse-drag.content navigation is easier and faster than Chrome's remote control arrow-down and page-down mouse navigation. I tested dozens of Android browsers. Lightning is the one with the best balance of features. Lightning is feature-rich like Chrome without the bloat, mouse-friendly like Firefox, and, best of all, it has options to offload certain links to external apps like YouTube that are better able to render content.  I also like READER MODE with independent font size and dark mode flexibility. Old versions of Lightning were fast but feature-poor. The new Lightning has both speed and great features.","I cannot import bookmarks from a backup file- not recognized. Finally, a web browser for small, lightweight devices like the Fire 7. It works like a charm. Other browsers struggle to load websites - this one doesn't. The only downside is that the bookmark export and import function doesn't work properly - the title and URL lines are reversed - easily fixed once the problem is recognized.","OUTDATED browser in terms of everything. Last updated in October 2019 which this browser is vulnerable to a lot if Security issues and bugs and hacks. Plus lacks too many features that other browsers provide. If developer improve and constantly takes suggestions from users like us then this can be good browser until then this is 1 star browser that is not suitable. One can understand dark theme enabled doesn't work irrespective of anything and in settings, different options causes jitters. Bad."],"appId":"acr.browser.barebones","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=acr.browser.barebones&hl=en&gl=us"}
