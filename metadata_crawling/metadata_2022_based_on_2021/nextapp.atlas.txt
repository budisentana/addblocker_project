There are many levels of control over elements of web pages which allows you to turn the modern annoying popup riddled and advertisement packed web into a fast and efficient information source like it used to be in the golden age of the web. Quick access slide out controls allow aspects of the page rendering to be controlled at a tap. Changes in the rendering take effect immediately. You can display pages as only text, a light mode with images, and full page rendering. You can tap to switch between device styles. Most useful is the ability to control text zooming and the text zooming overrides css styles built into the page. This makes it much easier to read text on web pages when using a small screen such as on a mobile phone. When tested on the Google Pixel phone the Atlas Web Browser performed faster than any of the 12 other browsers we tested.","I keep coming back to this browser after getting frustrated with others. Strengths are the the easy drawers, splitscreen, site settings memory, URL edits, and its ability to capture disclaimer pages that need to be tended to. Dev disinterest can be a good thing if they're not finding ways to get you!","Unlike the developers other apps (excellent) this one falls short. I had hopes for the browser but development seems to have stalled. The rather clunky navigation and lack of options have left this browser so far behind many others (which are free). Missing a simple home but (or at least I cannot find it). It is a shame but had to give up and use another better featured browser that is current.","Just stumbled upon this and wondering why more hasn't been done with this. It's such a wonderful browser, with nifty features and clean, functional interface. Probably the only one that allows viewing cookies individually (isn't working on Android 8.1 though) Tabs are so distinctly arranged. Things I wish to see (hopefully) in future— Tracking protection, more granular JavaScript controls, Dark Mode, Page save function, greater choice among search engines.","Avid xda user and you need (oddly enough) something to grind through it. Seemed to lag heavy but once pages actually appeared from the pure white screen it performed very well. With it's last update 18 months ago, i can't put money into it. I'd like to see better design, more user input and a general inclination to show a sign of development which may include user feedback. At 1.45 mb it clearly shows how much more less can be. After more testing, performance was WAY better without filters. hmmmm"],"appId":"nextapp.atlas","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.atlas&hl=en&gl=us"}
