Also, I enjoy the \"history\" function that enables me to go directly to a favored site. Finally, it does not hurt when it \"toots its own horn\" by informing the user of how many ads were blocked on the previous page. Keep up the good work !","This app tops ADs so good that I actually have to turn it to a lower setting or turn it off to use a few of my apps . When ever it's on , it's smooth sailing and it has so many filters and adjustments , so I know it has what you need . They have out- done themselves on this app. Shout out to the Developer on this one.","This thing is almost perfect. Most of the bad reviews are from people who don't know how it works. Only difficulty I'm having is that certain thumbnails, or toes of videos just don't load. Not really a big problem. As it is incredibly rare, and the video can usually be found elsewhere.","You should visit ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app for android. It's Adblock and FAST real. I have a constant ad popping up on my phone that I can't get rid of.Thought this would work,but it just made it worse and didn't block anything!A waste of time","Last review was back in 2018. This addon can't seem to \"block Ad's\" so it is 3 years LATER and this Application still SUCKS. And it's worse then it was back in \"2018\" when I last reviewed it. I've \"UNINSTALLED App.\" do to the Obvious FACT that this DOESN'T do ANYTHING to BLOCK Current AD Algorithms nor any \"Newer Ad's.\" It can't block the NEWER WAYS Being Used to get Ad's PAST ANY Inferior AD-BLOCKER, Such As This One. It truly is a Terrible app at \"blocking annoying Ad's.\" üëé üëé üëé üëé üëé"],"appId":"com.rocketshipapps.adblockfast","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rocketshipapps.adblockfast&hl=en&gl=us"}
