Current ad skipper doesn't mute, so this should have been an improvement. But the ads play fully, audibly, and autoplay is broken. So 3 out of 3 functions non-functional .","Plays full screen intrusive ads of its own for each setting you change in the app. Does not skip or mute YouTube ads at all.","When you comment or make the video smaller like to search another video it mutes. Ya really gotta fix this. If you do it will be the best app for skipping in the play store","Doesnt skip youtube app skip ad 》 at all. It could be due to the old version of android 4.42 this tablet has but for sure it is not working.","Good works great features work but... every time you activate something it triggers the same ad Edit: after a while it just stopped so I changed my review from a 4 to a 1"],"appId":"com.emmanuelmolefi.skipadsapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emmanuelmolefi.skipadsapp&hl=en&gl=us"}
