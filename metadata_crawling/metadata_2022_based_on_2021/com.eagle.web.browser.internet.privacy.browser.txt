I want to choose my own start page (homepage), would like to edit the list of links on the browsers home page and be able to delete ones I don't use. And, webpages loading would be nice. Please try testing the browser when you're connectedto reg. data and not just wifi as this browser is super slow on it. Update: Is still the same two years later, hard pass.","I have been using Private Browser on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A for several months and it has been working really great and I like it very much. I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab A7. I downloaded Private Browser on the A7 and it will not work at all; it will not access any website. On every website I try to access with the browser, I get a message that says \"UNABLE TO CONNECT\". It is definitely a problem with the browser since other browsers can access any website that I try to access.","I have started using this browser a year ago, when chrome started allowing nonsense webs to ride. So far this browser was very good. But since a month, it crashes suddenly. No info on the reason. I uninstalled and installed many ...times. no use. Good bye focus!","Meh,Slows up with multiple tabs. When going back once it close the tab instead of going back and when you save things to clioboard, if the app messes up all the things you've saved disappears. Sucks.","I updated this internet browser. I now cannot browse the internet with this internet browser. I hate updates. I have never met an update that improved anything and thjs update broke the program. It now says it cannot connect. It is not me it is this program. My other internet browsers work still. Guess I will uninstall. Oh well."],"appId":"com.eagle.web.browser.internet.privacy.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eagle.web.browser.internet.privacy.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
