Dunno why Samsung has this thing for throwing an insane amount of unnecessary and unmutable notifications at you when you first start your phone and many times after but thanks. Only thing I would ask for is to make the ability to clean the current notifications after a certain period of time. Log is good, just want to not have to always press clean. I Don't mind if its a premium feature.","This app stops annoying and unwanted notifications dead in their tracks. It is very easy to allow the notifications that you want while filtering out those that you don't want. Samsunc account notification was making my life hell and cannot be turned off or blocked from settings within the phone itself. This app took care of that in short order. I am so happy with it that I donated to it's development team. Awesome app!","This app is fantastic. It blocks all notifications from any or all apps you want and its not super annoying with the notification. The only issue i found is sometimes if you block messages from any messaging app, the app will still show the message but for a shorter time. I guess its because it has to know if it should block the messages or not and it takes it a second to read it. Overall i love it. Ive had it on all three of my phones.","Exactly what I needed. After my phone did a software update, I was no longer able to block all notifications with one tap. Now I can with this app, but this app is even better because it doesn't just block the notifications - it keeps them all in a tidy list for you to review when you actually want to. I am so much less distracted by notifcations now. Thank you.","Love this cleaner! I've been with Clean Master for years and was always satisfied with there service. It got to the point that the ads just bombard you. I understand you got to pay the bills but damn......... When you run off long time users. Anyway I tried many cleaner apps before I found this one. None really did what they said..... But yours is perfect. There's ads but that is to be expected. Simple and easy to use. Really works. Keep up the good work. Hope we have a long partnership."],"appId":"co.easy4u.ncleaner","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.easy4u.ncleaner&hl=en&gl=us"}
