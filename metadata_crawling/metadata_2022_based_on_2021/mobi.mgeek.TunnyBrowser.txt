Maybe I'll return, if the problem is resolved, but only if other options don't pan out.","If you update after install, it will never work again afterwards. This is an on-going problem for years with each version and each update. Complaints to maker go nowhere. It will be great upon initial install but will crash afterwards if you install any update, forcing you to delete app. You'll lose all your saved links on home screen, all your favorites, etc. That is why I give it a 1 star rating.","I love this browser and have been using it for many years. I just got a new phone and every time I try to login to transfer bookmarks, ect it says network error. I've tried it on wifi and with my phone's data and says the same thing...on both phones! Is there a setting I need to change or is it just the app? Any help would be appreciated!!","Crash, used for 5 years on Android, but today I formatted my phone and reinstalled everything due to my battery not charging, but still won't charge.. Only charges on the wireless dock. Anyway after installing this again, I've installed it many times before and this time, it refuses to login with my account. I had all my stuff backed up on it also, it just keeps giving me a error can't find web page. So Im stuck, all my history and Metadata are useless without the login.","Something happened with this latest version, the browser does not prompt for image uploads. While on Facebook or Google Photos and clicking the button to add photos, nothing happens. There's no screen that comes up to let you select photos. I have all permissions enabled and I tried reinstalling the app, and it works for me in Chrome. Please be advised."],"appId":"mobi.mgeek.TunnyBrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.mgeek.TunnyBrowser&hl=en&gl=us"}
