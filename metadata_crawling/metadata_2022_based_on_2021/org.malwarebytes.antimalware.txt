If I hadn't found the possible presence of malware, which leads me to check MWB's status, I would never know that my paid subscription & RTP was not active. This has happened several times in recent years. This recurring problem, along with other issues that tech support never completely fixes is why I've decided it's become necessary to search for new malware & virus protection!","It does a complete scan, finds no issues, and then gives me a message that there are two critical issues to fix. I ran the scan again.. same result, no issues. It seems that the critical issue is that I haven't subscribed to the premium service. I've uninstalled it rather than being told that I have a critical issue when I don't.","Still 6-7-22. This app is so worthless. Hitting update does nothing. Diagnostic info is still enabled by default before you can disable! Buttons are laggy and slow to respond. Interface is confusing. Some things can't be ignored or swiped away. I'd never pay for the premium version of this. My old phones are the only ones that even \"need\" it. If you have a flagship I suggest skipping mobile AV, it mostly does nothing IMO. Just be aware what you click and who to trust. I don't trust these guys.","Very thorough and easy to use. I find the \"News\" section to be highly interesting, educational, and practical. I'm amazed by the sheer number of public and private entities that are fighting for every bit of information, even the control, of my phone. All the while coluding and conspiring with each other to get better at it and keep that their \"huge (illegal) secret\" as long as they can.","used premium version a couple years ago and remember every time I downloaded an app/file it would scan the app/file and notify if it was safe. Just started premium again and nothing, I have to manually scan even though it says realtime protection is active. I enabled the browser scanner, admin too and no difference. downloaded a pdf and it opened automatically before I could scan. no way to scan individual files, and no way to specifically run a FULL scan. what happened to this app!?"],"appId":"org.malwarebytes.antimalware","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.malwarebytes.antimalware&hl=en&gl=us"}
