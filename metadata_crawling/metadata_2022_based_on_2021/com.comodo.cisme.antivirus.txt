For whatever reason, it is not showing and the premium features aren't working yet either. Why is this? Comodo has done it again! Easiest and most dependable antivirus ever!!!!! I tried to stop and then open it. In fact, I restarted my phone and then reopened Comodo. Unfortunately, the issue still exists.","Doesn't seem to do much but slow my phone down. Wants me to verify email address but never sends me the verification email or message of any kind. 'Firewall' and 'App on Top' do the exact same thing. So no proper firewall I guess. It's never ever found a virus or any other malicious software, if it has it never alerted me to them. I feel like this is a fake app not really doing anything but harvesting information most likely.","It's better than some others I've tried, but still has issues. Flagged several apps other AVs didn't, and I suspect most, if not all, are false positives. And it only gives very vague information about them, just saying they're \"suspicious.\" Emailed support about it 3 weeks ago and got no response. Then just opened it and it was orange, saying I needed to do a system scan, even though the weekly scheduled scan ran this morning per the log, which also shows it found 3 risky apps but gives no way to see which ones. So I started a scan, then immediately tried to cancel it, though it took a couple minutes of trying before it finally stopped. And then all of a sudden it was green, so either that triggered it to recognize that a scan wasn't needed, or it accepted the brief, partial scan as enough, either of which are a problem. Time to try another app.","This app did great for scanning for malware. It found and removed at least 2 browser hijackers. However, it would be great if I was able to view a list of the files that contained browser hijackers. While it is fantastic that I am able to see which apps were potentially problematic, it simply tells me that they contain components that engage in malicious activity. It doesn't tell me what type of malicious activity, such as a Tracker, browser hijacker, or virus. It just tells me that the app could be up to something nasty. Would give 5 stars if the app was able to tell me exactly what types of problems the apps it removed could be causing. Otherwise, easy-to-use, self-explanatory, and effective! Thank you so much for creating such a great app!","Offers some interesting features I installed this because of the reputation for the desktop firewall. This app is not comparable, and is kind of a let down. Used this before for call blocking and that's since been removed. I get potential false positives all the time with this because it tells you aren't 'safe' until all sub-products are active , or my favorite 'under attack' with no logs , details, and just a simple red and green button. Hardly what I would call security. Would not recommend."],"appId":"com.comodo.cisme.antivirus","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.comodo.cisme.antivirus&hl=en&gl=us"}
