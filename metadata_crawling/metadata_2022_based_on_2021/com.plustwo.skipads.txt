However, if you turn off your phone or put it into power saving mode it turns off accessibility and no longer works. Really annoying to have to reset it every time. I'll be removing app.","The app keeps not working properly.. every few days I have to go in and turn off accessability stuff again and turn it back on again or ads wont mute or skip I will be uninstalling this app..","This app used to be good, but it has gotten worse.it used to mute the ads and press skip, now it mutes the ad, but does not skip! Please fix this. This app is really useful, but what I just mentioned ruins it. Edit: this app is completely useless. It NEVER skips, and it mutes the add 1/10 times. I'm uninstalling this app now.","Works fairly well with YouTube. That was before the app became toxic! The app developers watch when you first load it. They let it run smoothly at first till your comfortable with its performance. If you do not opp for the no commercials at a cost, that is when the app fails and becomes toxic to have. The developers of the app are not into it for free and no paid advertising does not put money in the bank for them and I understand. But that is when they spring there mousetrap on you. Pay up!!","It works but when you turn your phone off and turn it back on it stopped working. The \"Accessibility\" option should not be on it. It should be built into the app to allow the app to work when turned on through the app not the phone. Because the phone renders the app useless if you turn it off and turn it back on you have to repeat the process every single time."],"appId":"com.plustwo.skipads","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plustwo.skipads&hl=en&gl=us"}
