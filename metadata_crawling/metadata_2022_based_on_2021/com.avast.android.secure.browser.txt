I tried to sign in and even create an account but it would do nothing when you press sign in or even create account it would literally do nothing then if you try to click sync it just goes back to sign in with username and password so it's stuck in a loop and a VPN gets stuck on previously selected locations I've tried everything so I don't really know what to do except for ask for a refund. My issue has been fixed and have not had another issue.","I love the desktop browser features. So I wanted to give the app a try for the sync experience and the free VPN. Unfortunately, it won't let me sign in to sync. I'll type in my email and password, then press the sign in button. And nothing. No response whatsoever. After pressing repeatedly, it only takes me back to the previous screen","Too many irritating problems and I'm uninstalling. When I click on a link and the browser opens, the page doesn't load.  I have to manually copy and paste the link or jump through some other hoop. Often, the browser will behave as-if there's no internet connection when there is.  No improvement after most recent update. I've been unable to complete captchas but have success in other browsers, etc.  I want to like it and I tried but I just can't... I don't need the aggrevation.","It's more frustrating than not. Occasionally it performs as expected, but there are moments when I try to open a random page and nothing is happening for minutes on end. I do enjoy the privacy the browser offers and other encryption utilities, but these random wait moments are not letting me enjoy the experience.","The first time I've had a chance to get into a stable, linear path to comprehension. With more insightful, user-friendly content, I can pick up on things quickly. The foreign language that I thought was going to make sense in it's usage and application, etc...didn't. Without context to give the words meaning, I kept getting hung up on each one losing sight of the functions they serve. I'm still stumbling about...but not so much in the dark...Aces!"],"appId":"com.avast.android.secure.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avast.android.secure.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
