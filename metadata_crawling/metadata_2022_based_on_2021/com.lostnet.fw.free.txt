Used to travel internationally for work back in the day, and this saved me gobs of roaming fees. Planning some travel this summer, and tried it again, but it won't even open on my Android 12 device. Understandable, BTW, it hasn't been updated since 2014. Bummer, it had a lot of features that I can't find in current offerings!","Dropped rating from 3 to 1. Lostnet is a really good name for this as you really do lose your internet. Also email loses sync and it crashes from time to time. Experimenting over. Uninstalled. It was probably good in its day but since it is not supported now I suggest you look for something else","Needs a \"Data Only\" option too, not just a \"Wifi Only\" option. Love the Block Region and Block Country option, and Block All apps with one click. All settings must be reset after crash, and sometimes app just stops... looses vpn control.. crashes too much. Also deleted apps still show in app list. Any update planned? No update in over 5 yrs. deleted now.","Had to take my rating from 5 to 3 as the app crashes in the background and this causes that ALL apps are blocked with NO indication at all. On one day I missed all my emails, whatsapp and more for more than 5 hours. Now I am forced to use another firewall as that glitch is an app breaker. I really hope you can sort it out. Really liked the app :( Old rating: Works great! No adds that bug you. Really saves data and battery very well. The best no root firewall by far! Well done developers.","worked immediately. gives a msg what's going on. great graphics. u guys are awesome. will review again, to report whether it stops the annoying double click ads from constantly appearing, everything I open an app."],"appId":"com.lostnet.fw.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lostnet.fw.free&hl=en&gl=us"}
