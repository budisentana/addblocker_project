I can access the history, search bar, and more from the new tab page. This app works as intended; nothing stops you from accessing anything. Would rate 6 stars if I could because it does everything it says it does and more. My only complaint is that downloads don't seem to work? I'm not sure if this is just my phone but hopefully it's just a bug with the app.","I really like the app, although, haven't figured it out completely. I would love to no how and what to do , about everything it has to offer . There are words, phrases, that I don't no what they meen or say or do, because I'm the consumer. Maybe if you could dissect each tak,an show example of how to do it, would result in peole keeping the app,rather than getting frustrated with it, and uninstalling it. If you could simplify things more,I would give 5 stars, and please, lose the ads.","Straight away the app can't and won't bypass my network providers content block. This is a very basic block that even free inbuilt browser VPN or even Google translate can bypass so I have little faith it would actually protect you where it matters. You have to use the browser so apps like Netflix are a no go, the browser itself is very basic again instilling little faith. I did notice there were no ads, however for the price they are asking you can get far superior products for cheaper.","Very helpful, good speed as compared to other available proxy browser, I'll recommend to try it out .","What's WRONG with this app !!?? Let me tell you what's wrong, this app doesn't work at all, everytime i try to open it and browse something, it always failed, connection reset or something equally annoying. I updated the app regularly everytime i had notification to do so yet it keep failing me. This app used to be fine, i even gave 5 stars rating the first time i used it. Nevertheless it's not working now and i'm so dissapointed."],"appId":"com.udicorn.proxybrowser.unblockwebsites","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.udicorn.proxybrowser.unblockwebsites&hl=en&gl=us"}
