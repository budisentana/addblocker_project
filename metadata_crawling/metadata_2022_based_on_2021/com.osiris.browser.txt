I tried a couple of other apps, but they were slow and cumbersome. This will bookmark the site I need and the response time is inline with most normal servers. I don't use this for my day-to-day surfing, but it has flash, or the flash-like capabilities that I needed. I see it as a nice alternative when you need that flexibility.","For browsing in gen awsome but I de-rate because despite pleas from many users U don't/wont follow UI day/night or offer in settings it's basic & in every other serious browser, also in most every serious is bookmarks sync either built in or through plugin. I've waited and waited & still no see (pun intended) so U go from 5 * to 3 to 2 in 6 mo. no joy, 1 * if no by next year and up when U get 1 of these, back to 5 * when we get both... Sorry but it's just too painfull @ night..!","The browser is fast and smooth. Yes, the page loading is fast, but I actually dislike the night mode. As the night mode should be black not dark blue and the background is black for the homepage. Besides that, you did not mention the meaning of the 4 symbols at the osiris statics. But, overall it is more than I expected. Give u guys 5 Stars!","Great app. Only problem is that it lacks ad blocking on some sites. Please fix this issue. That would be helpful. Just some improvements and this app will be better.","Mmmm... I can add bookmark easily to every site. but when I want to add a page to favorite, that icon doesn't show up most of the time. What's the condition to add a site to fav? Or is that a bug? And if you can add triple dots to access menu somewhere (top-right in chrome), that would be helpful for smartphone that doesn't have 'right click' button"],"appId":"com.osiris.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.osiris.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
