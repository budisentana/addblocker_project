For your safety we recommend you to stop using Cliqz. The Cliqz Team invite you to use the Ghostery Browser or suggest picking alternative of your choice.","comments":["I like it. I switched from Chrome to this thing and I think I did the right decision. It is the only browser/search engine combination that worked for me and make me stay away from google almost impossible to beat service offerings (but non-private and intrussive). Because of the non-working zoom feature I give it four stars (even though it is fixed now).","Well... It's a browser. It displays pages. But to be honest I don't see any killer features to use it unless one is a blind Germany patriot(as I understood the fact that it's developed in Germany is propelled as one of the biggest advantages but in reality it's very doubtful). It drags behind Chrome and Yanded browser in terms of features and overall experience even worse than in mobile firefox and that speaks for itself. Basically it's technologically retarded browser made in Germany.","It's good but has some issues. Reader mode triggers sometimes by itself, some settings do not have effect, there could be more most visited sites - only four are shown and the rest of the screen is just blank.","Best. privacy. browser. EVER! I tried Ghostery, FF Focus, duckduckgo, & many other private browsers. Cliqz is THE BEST. Full/tweaked/custom privacy; never crashes/freezes/slows down/slows your phone. 20-40 tabs open regularly, Cliqz handles fine! 97 TABS OPEN & NO CRASH/NO FREEZING! Come on, what other privacy (or not!) browser comes close?? Missing some options (font size for old eyes, lol!), but well worth it: sets the bar HIGH for all other browsers. How they do it, IDK! Simply ausgezeichnet!","The only missing thing on this browser, is bookmarks and password synch, other than no problem, I love the simple interface and the privacy settings. I hate having to install extensions that only bloat your browser. Please consider adding a home button in the search bar"],"appId":"com.cliqz.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cliqz.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
