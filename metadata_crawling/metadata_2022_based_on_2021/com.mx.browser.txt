I have been using Maxthon for roughly 8 years and have always been satisfied. The android version crashes frequently, shows a bunch of bookmarked icons on the main page that I can't remove. I can add more but can't take the ones there by default away. Make the Android version more like the PC version and I will be happy.","Very slow and annoying. This browser always want to open THREE instances of the same page when I launch from a saved hyperlink. That makes it VERY slow to open the page. I have to close two of the three pages manually to get it to load in a reasonable amount of time. UPDATE: Uninstalling. Despite dev saying he can reproduce, the issue resolved \"itself\" after a couple updates. Now however, the password keeper doesn't register new logins. Do not waste your time with this browser.","Sorry guys I've been using y'all for years even had you on my desktop way back when I was in school still. I even spoke very high praises of the browser. These last few updates, I can't download anything and if it says it does download it, it can't open it and when I go to look for it I can't even find the file. Not to mention every time I minimize and reopen maxthon, all the tabs are doubled sometimes tripled. Earlier this morning it just upped and deleted a tab while I switching between them.","To me, a browser is a browser for the most part. Maxthon mobile has the advantage that it can save your preference to \"always view desktop site\". I use several browsers on my phone & most allow you to switch from mobile to view the desktop version of websites but mostly can't permanently set to request desktop site by default. A huge disadvantage for me is Maxthon limits itself to ONLY 20 tabs (-2⭐).","This browser has SOOO much potential. But it keeps saying I'm disconnected feom the internet, when im clearly not. It doesn't always load sites properly and there is NOT personalization options available."],"appId":"com.mx.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mx.browser&hl=en&gl=us"}
