Works mostly as advertised. Blocks apps from accessing the internet. I have it enabled and certain apps blocked but I do notice that some apps I have allowed full access all the time will either not work or not connect. Also, does make my phone crash about every 30 minutes when using.","Updated: Firewall App does slow down other apps as it filters out the unwanted. Firewall stopped some apps from access to the wifi or network if you so choose. However, with that said, turning off wifi and network access may not stop all apps from still accessing them. As the developers stated, you can go in and manually turn off individual urls of a specific app. I think the app cost to much, but I did buy it. Cost $42.49 with tax.","Ever wondered what your phone is up to? Well the answer is \"spying\" on you. Yes, you! Packed with block lists for bad actors, polished Ui and very clever technology, Protectstar firewall has got you! Its not, repeat, not a VPN. It uses the VPN pathway get around the need to root your device. Rooting is not recommended if you aren't technically adept. Otherwise root just becomes a security risk. Protectstar Firewall gives peace of mind especially when used with their other products! 10/10","I like this APP, it makes me feel protected at the ease of a switch. Although One thing I've noticed this app has to be turned off to log into certain sites. The question is in doing so aren't I leaving my phone more vulnerable to attachs? Making it easier or more accessible to more? Honestly I'm technically challenged so I may not understand all the processes. I have backup protection that allows me into my more secure Apps with the protection on. Between the two I feel fairly comfortable.","Absolutely love it! I have a phone with Google Workspace. It works fine on both the personal and work sides. It even works in my secur folder where I have installed a separate Gmail and Play Store. All work at the same time (on my other phone). Love the ability to force apps to use it or not and turn off wifi access since I have unlimited data and do not use it."],"appId":"com.protectstar.firewall","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.protectstar.firewall&hl=en&gl=us"}
