Feel so much more focused and productive! I often get sucked into social media and reading random articles etc when I should be doing other things and this has completely stopped it. I also feel much better blocking out the internet and social media throughout the day. It's improving my mental health. Only thing I'd say is I don't understand how it's so expensive. But it is very worth it for me.","Much of functionalities that are missing here available in Lock Me Out app. Basic features such as: categorizing apps you want to block, have a whitelist, disable the ability to change a session 30 minutes before it starts, app usage based locks are simply not there. I haven't even gotten to the bugs yet. Can't remember the last time I've seen an update. I'm not sure what takes them so slow to add features and improve their software. Definitely not the best app blocker out there.","Generally really good experience - experiencing a glitch. For some reason - Undertaking a challenge which blocks all apps repeatedly opens the task manager for me which makes my phone useless. I thought it was a hardware or unrelated software issue so I did a factory reset which seemed to fix the issue until I redownloaded Freedom again, therefore starting the issue again. Otherwise - Great app.","Great app. Works great across all devices, phone included. Very convenient management in the dashboard. Great cloud synchronization of this dashboard. Love this app and recommend it to any focus-driven junkie like me, who can't find a solution for them on the market. This app worked for me perfectly, and I tried like 5-10 different apps (cold turkey, and others) , this one I liked the best and sticked with it. Thanks to developers, appreciate this app a lot, guys!","This is the only premium apps that I can recommends to my friends easily because it helped me to do productive activity daily. Thank you and I hope it would improve more in the future."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"to.freedom.android2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=to.freedom.android2&hl=en&gl=au"}
