Only thing is that it no longer opens on the android 12 beta, which is completely understandable because android 12 is supposed to be released to the masses in August-ish. Hopefully you'll fix that.","I have used this app for years, and It has been a great tool. My only gripe is that I can't carry over bookmarks, or even find the app data to do it myself. If they allowed book-mark exporting and importing, it would be perfect, especially when a ohone croaks like mine did 2 years back. (I lost all my bookmarks ;( )","It is a great application, but in the latest release the Notification Bar and the Web Screen elements started flelicering and changing between White, Grey and Black colors, just like if the screen was broken.","I went to google search and it knew instantly I had an older version of chrome even though chrome was off. This is not a private browser, it is a window into your computer.","Super fast basic browser. Seems to have fixed the crashing when sites open a new window."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.lechneralexander.privatebrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lechneralexander.privatebrowser&hl=en&gl=au"}
