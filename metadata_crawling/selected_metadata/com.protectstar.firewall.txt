Their other tool Camera Blocker stops Settings, Accessibities and Google Play from using the camera... I'm guessing android.root is behind that. I've never rooted my phone, and suspect android.root may have been loaded at the store, as clerk oddly spent several minutes tapping away before handing me the phone. So do I Factory Reset? HELP!","Man this app is amazing on so many levels, it allows the user to block ads at their root stopping them entirely it puts the control back into the users hands rather than the greedy devs instead of having 1000 ads forced down our throats, not to mention it saves my data its brilliant!, the only question I have is does this app allow you to use it on multiple devices or is it a single purchase per device if I can use it on multiple android devices I'd buy the lifetime one just a bit worried.","Maybe I'm using the app wrong, but it blocked EVERYTHING I tried to do. It blocked Google Play, Brave and Chrome searches, blocked access to my bank and was constantly beeping with notifications of blocked connections. Ininstalled it before it drove me nuts","The best privacy app in details but it freezing the connection once in a while and you have no Internet connection untill you stop it and start again. Tried already 3 versions and same bug even I set it to never sleep","My Samsung a51 was just hacked a week ago. I've installed this and it locks up any potential routes my hacker's software is trying to go. Lots of good information and control over processes, much I don't understand.... But after losing / using 4g of data in the 2 days. I now control that. Its given me some breathing room to figure out what to do. I able to open up a mobile hotspot and use my data plan from a different device. Thank you developers!!!
