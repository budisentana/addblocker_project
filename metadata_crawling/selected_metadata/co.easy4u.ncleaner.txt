I am disappointed that I have to check my settings thoroughly after my phone is reatarted for any reason. As long as I don't restart, all nuisance notifications don't annoy me. Also, I can review them at a time or my choosing if I want to. Overall, a great review from me. Update: now I have to randomly block ongoing notifications often and when I haven't booted. I'm changing my rating because I think the developer might be more likely to see this new problem.","EDIT: NB had been running perfect now the a while bWhile there are some problems that have popped up, the developer is working to try to fix them. He has asked specifically the trouble shooting methods I've done, to help him catch up, after his busy times. As promised this is now back up to 5 stars, even tho there are still issues. Eric is one of the most responsive devs I've contacted over the years.","I've used this for a couple of years...it really works well but I may uninstall because of spammy ads. It's NOT ok to take over my phone with noisy, cheap ads which I can't stop or even turn sound off...I was thinking about purchasing app until these started...the ads are just completely OTT & really destroy what was a great app",".Edit: this no longer happens :) -will give 5 stars when the app stops making me click dismiss each time I clean notifications when it asks me to leave a review. I would expect when I pay to not have to expect such popups to appear","Had an update for my Galaxy S10 which is apparently terrible, so had a persistent notification to update that I couldn't hide. Not until I installed this app. Perfect. Thank you!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.easy4u.ncleaner","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.easy4u.ncleaner&hl=en&gl=au"}
