The past 2+ days now the service has been either disconnected or such a high ping rate. The VPN has regularly disconnected and failed to reconnect because the server connected to is no longer available. I raised emailed with support to ask if they are under attack - no reply. I sent screenshots to show the unavailability/high pings, no acknowledgement. Shame I recently extended my subscription during the current offer, I would not have bothered given these issues of late. With slow/poor tech support, the only thing going for the app is UK speed when connected and the integration into Adguard. If you don't use Adguard (which is great and totally recommend), then I currently suggest looking for another VPN provider that maybe more reliable and have quicker/better support. (NordVPN, ExpressVPN, ProtonVpn are just 3 examples of such)","Forgive me if I misunderstood, but of late YouTube ads are becoming out of control, both in frequency and length. I finally installed an ad blocker, and this was recommended. I filled in all the blurb and the sign says I am connected. However I still am getting ads. Will have to try an alternative package.","I love AdGuard VPN support timely responses and how subscriber concerns are addressed. I just want to say a big thank you to the development team for providing an affordable and very reliable VPN service. I recently installed the Orbot application to enable Tor compatibility as well. Thanks AdGuard.","Great product. Easy to use. All round protection. Lifetime access is well worth it over 3 devices.","Speed is capped, i have 100mps plan i get 1.2 mpbs surfing speed but when i am using express vpn, i get 80 mbps....pls work on this, secondly, i am giving 5 star just because i depend on ur other app for ads blocking and it is not in play store..uninstalled this"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.adguard.vpn","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adguard.vpn&hl=en&gl=au"}
