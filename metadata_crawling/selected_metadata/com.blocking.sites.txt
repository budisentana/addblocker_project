Yes it does block, but only for once, you can easily access a newly installed app even if it was blocked with a password on by downloading that app. The blocker will block your access, then you just open the blocker and then go back to the blocked app, the new app gets unblocked. Can you please fix this bug","Great app for blocking sensitive content and customizing what you want to be blocked. One problem is that i can't whitelist some words that are usual in my language. For example the word 'how' is 'cum' in my language and i can't whitelist it so if i search 'how to...' in my language it blocks every site that i acces. It would be great if you coud fix this so i can whitelist these words. something like foreign language whitelist. option. Thank you!","FINALLY, A BLOCKER THAT ACTUALLY WORKS. After trying all the existing blockers on Play Store, this one is the real deal. It's easy to configure, and it makes nearly impossible to uninstall it or change the settings. I tested many many others and they are all flawed. As soon as I type a blocked keyword or website the app blocks it and prevent you from going further. Amazing! Pair this with a specific app for limiting screen/apps time and you're set to be best version of yourself. Thanks!!!","It is very good at blocking inapropiate results but sometimes there can be a blind spot, like after you are sent back you can type something you blocked and wont block up untill you search it again,and it wont also wont alow me to change from server 2 to server 1 just moving back to server 1 every time I go back to the home page as well when I reopen the blocker.","This is one of the best working apps I have found so far and it is at a good price. They seem to have thought of everything and if I ever have any issues with the app they are quick to reply and solve the issue."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.blocking.sites","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blocking.sites&hl=en&gl=au"}
