What's the point of this if you won't allow full blockage without playing the ads? Update: absolutely does NOT block out ads at all. It doesn't even skip all of them either. This app is complete trash plus now i'm getting ads out of nowhere. Do not download this or you'll regret it","I thought it didn't work because when I tapped the button to start it, it just took me to my phone settings. Then I scrolled down and realized that you have to turn it on. It would have been nice if the app told you this. Plus, ads on an ad blocking app? Come on. EDIT: It worked immediately after I figured this out. Then I went to YouTube the next morning, and it showed an ad! I went back into my settings, and this app had turned itself off!","The app never launches and just keeps crashing. I tried checking authorisations but everything was correctly set. It just doesn't work. It's quite disappointing since I was looking forward to this apps features.","Never worked, only crashed on launch after installing. There's about 100 negative reviews here and no effort by the publishers to answer them. This is probably a sign of why ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘Ž","I didn't know I already had this and was disappointed to learn I did. I returned to the store looking for an adblocker.
