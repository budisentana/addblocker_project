This app actually is great and thanks to the channel which recommended me the app, you should check out \"TheHowToGuy123\" on YouTube. I'm giving it 4 stars becuz when the ad fades away at the end, there is a little cut where the last 1 second of the ad is played when it fades to the next song. I know that there is an option to disable the fade away music on Spotify but I like the way music fades away. Great app!!","Great launcher for spotify. Has all the needs. Great staff nice dev time. Simple and straight forward. Personally I have not had any ads but I have an ad-blocker and vpn. 5 star no complaints!","Great app.I suggest adding a feature such that the ads will remain muted even if we manually changed them.Also you can modify the logo so that more people will download it. All other things work fine.Keep up the good worküëçüèª","Love it. Mutes the annoying ads from Harry's shaving blades, capital one credit cards, qfc, Fred Meyer, Kroger etc.","An excelent ideea, it work like an external player for Spotify that when you have have comercials the app is mutifying the sound. Now I listen music thru this app. Thanks to developer."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"live.teekamsuthar.mutify","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.teekamsuthar.mutify&hl=en&gl=au"}
