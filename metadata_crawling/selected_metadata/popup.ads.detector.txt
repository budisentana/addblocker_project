I will wait to update the rating either way, I just hope those ads are gone bc they keep coming up while trying to answer a call or while I'm trying to text and it is so√≥ooo frustrating!!","This is one of the best apps i have used. Once installed it took about less than a minute for me to identify the apps that where causing the pop-ups adds etc. The free floating icon even showed a picture of the app in the icon, and asked if i wanted to uninstall it. In my case it was the Barcode scanner and the CNN app that was causing the problem, both where uninstalled. No problems since. The in app ads were small and uninstructive. I had two ad blockers installed that didn't do anything. This works. Regards","C'mon! What could be better than this? It surely deserves 5 stars. It solved my problem in only 1 minute. An ad showed up immediately while opening this app and it detected which app showed the pop-up! Omg, it was an unknown file. I immediately deleted it! And nkw it's been 3 hours and no ads! I loved this app, I just don't understand why people rate it 1 stars!","Honestly, I had my doubts at first. But it found an unknown app on my phone that I didn't know I had and after uninstalling the unknown app, the popups stopped. This is surprisingly a really good app!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"popup.ads.detector","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=popup.ads.detector&hl=en&gl=au"}
