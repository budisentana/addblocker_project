It's the worst. Totally. After update I lost all tabs and stored data. Now it uses 8GB plus of storage, when not in use. I was offered three years of unlimited use. Accepted. Seemed to work. That doesn't work anymore. Just a huge fail. Get this thing OFF MY PHONE!!","This is probably the first app that went beyond my expectations after I download from an ads. Just super solid for a free app. So after reading the new reviews, knowing that it's not possible to download anymore. This app doesn't seem appealing anymore. Don't get me wrong, your app is still helpful. It's just that it used to be amazing. That's a sad thing to look at.","Idea is good but execution is poor, the download manager is the worst one i have seen lately, it's in 2010 no information provided in download manager, 8/10 times the download fails half way, loosing my data completely. How hard is it to make a clean download manager in 2021 ?. Tenta browsers downloads fail about 9 times out of 10 halfway..when any other browser downloads without a hitch.","I have the problem that the app, after some time using it, keeps not responding and crashing. Force stopping the application solves the freeze for about 2 seconds then it freezes up again... Reinstalling the app actually solves the issue, but after a while it happens again... I used to really like this browser but with having to go through all this, is really making me want to switch üòï","Used to be great but just completely doesn't work anymore and hasn't worked for going on 4 months i just keep forgetting to uninstall this app. Can't even load the home page anymore without the app crashing. Il cone back when it works. (Update 01/13/2021) worked for a while now its broken again. Hasn't worked now for multiple weeks. Freezes everytime I try to turn on my VPN or open a page."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tenta.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tenta.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
