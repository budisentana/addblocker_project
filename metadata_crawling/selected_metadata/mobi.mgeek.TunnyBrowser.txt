Can't have many tabs open or it will implode. Doesn't remember logins; I have to keep logging into sites every time. Won't open links in new tabs anymore regardless of the setting. Out of date. Dolphin is now unsupported on many sites so I constantly have to switch over to Chrome to view sites that won't open with Dolphin any more. In short, Dolphin is a hot mess. I prefer Dolphin over Chrome but Dolphin is becoming unusable.","The problem I have with this app when I select a phrase or name that's trending under the search bar it appears brings me to results of a search in which \"null\" was the keyword. This issue is minor and I don't use that feature often but it is very annoying. Seems like it would be an easy fix. One of my favorite web browsers though. Other than that small issue I think the app is great!","Full of bugs after the latest update (12/6/2020). App crashes once a day and wipes out all open tabs. App refuses to open/display web pages when you click on an ad in the search results, even if it's the page you're looking for. Random embedded Flash/Java scripts will not play. I've tried sending in 'support requests,' but they go unanswered. Switched to Brave Browser. Much better!","Used to be good, but now 2 problems. I had to hard reset my phone to troubleshoot problem. I backed up my bookmarks to an html file. ( Was using a prev version of dolphin at the time.) Of course, when I reset, I had to reinstall dolphin from Google PS, which was the most recent version. I tried to restore bookmarks, nothing happens, not even an error msg. The second problem I have is sometimes when dolphin has been up a while, it stops giving me keyboard on any website in entry forms. Buggy.","Horrible App! Fix it! Beginning to lag and blink when initiating page loads. Keeps shutting down/abruptly closing. Highly irritating! Don't ignore these complaints! Fix it!
