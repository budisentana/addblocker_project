I installed samsung internet as adviced and one day later Samsung started notifying me that adblock plus is not working despite of doing all necessary settings and enabling it from list of ad blockers. I wish adblock would make its own web browser so they don't have to rely on anyone. I would be the first one to download it.","I'm scrolling through a page, 40 plus things that yada yada & I can't get through it with the ads. This app does NOT filter ads AT ALL. Zero stars if I could.","It absolutely does not block any pop ups from appearing while your browsing the internet or on Yoututube. It would have been amazing had the app actually did it's job like the computer version. Until this issue is fixed and the app becomes usable I wouldn't waste time and space downloading it.","Definitely does NOT block ads as I see loads of ads when on websites on my Samsung phone using Samsung browser. The version on my Mac laptop seems to work better, although I get lots of annoying ads on YouTube when I used to happily get none. Have always used this Adblocker so it's not like I changed apps.","Been using this for a long time but recently started crashing on me. Only way I can get it to block ads again is by uninstalling and reinstalling."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.adblockplus.adblockplussbrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adblockplus.adblockplussbrowser&hl=en&gl=au"}
