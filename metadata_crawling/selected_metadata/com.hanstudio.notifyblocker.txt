Also a great example of ad placement that is not intrusive and I don't mind. The only thing I'd request is the option to show the sticky notification for blocked notifications *without* seeing which apps have notified me, or any indication of how many there are. I'd rather it just say \"you have some notifications\" rather than showing the little apps icons, because otherwise it distracts me and I keep opening the notifications if I see a certain app there.","Everything became so peacefull all of a sudden .I only realized why when I decided to check the time and saw 25 blocked messages...thank you for this peace bringer.It should be right up there with the invention of....toilet paper .","Trying to block my samsung update notification but when I use this app it just has its own notification that lets me know what it's blocked so what's the point lol... Fixedddd just disable notifications for this app. Only complaint is that I have to re block it every restart","This is for developers: Can you please group notifications that come from the same application, similar to how Ncleaner does it. Otherwise it's so annoying to scroll through tens or hundreds notifications from Gmail or Facebook when I could just clean the whole group for Gmailor other app. Also sometimes (quite often) you get double notifications from Gmail for example. Otherwise excellent App and will give it 5 stars after the above fixed.","Great app! So very many ways to customize! I've been looking for an app like this FOREVER!! Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.hanstudio.notifyblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hanstudio.notifyblocker&hl=en&gl=au"}
