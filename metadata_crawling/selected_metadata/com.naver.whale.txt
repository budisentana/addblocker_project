Can you please fix the issue with full screen still showing the gesture pill at the bottom. Also would like if you would add amoled black as an option instead of dark mode. Will change to 5 if these are changed.","Latest update includes DuckDuckGo in the address bar choices! Ad blocking switch included but a but weak. Lots of cool functionality. World class browser. PC version rocks, I use it exclusively. Great to sync phone/pc. Solid reliable company and great customer service.","Using it as daily drive and fell in love with the browser. Please add these features. 1. Ad blocker and malicious content blocker needed like brave browser. 2. Needed audio only playback for playing video contents.","Love it If possible please add the ability to play downloaded video on the app itself because its pip video player is great UPDATE Please make it compatible with the force RTL mode","Scrapbook is the best feature!! But also PLEASE ADD A 24HOUR CLOCK OPTION on the homescreen widget.
