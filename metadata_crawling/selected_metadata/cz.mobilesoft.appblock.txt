Do you want to prevent yourself form bypassing blocked applications by downloading new ones? In that case, simply check Add newly installed applications and all the applications you install from now on will be added to the blocked list.","comments":["It is really cool app and I have also bought the premium but it does not work anymore for MIUI. I can easily unlock the app from recent manager and clear RAM. That way the block stops until I start appblock again . So I can easily bypass the block. I have applied everything given in the troubleshooting but nothing works anymore. Really annoying.","Don't buy Premium. If you have to uninstall, you will have to purchase it again. In fact, if you uninstall, you will have to set up the profiles all over again. I contacted the developer who was unable to help. I don't understand why they don't just create a login so the user does t have to set up everything if it had to be reinstalled or worse, purchase Premium again. I am uninstalling it and going to use a competitor.","I tried to purchase a monthly subscription for your app Appblock. The money was debited from my account. But it later showed that the purchase failed since my card isn't eligible for recurring payments. Now I don't have the subscription or the money. In the play Store app, this purchase can be seen under my purchases. When I requested refund on the Google Play Store app, it's shown that the refund cannot be made. I dont know what to do!!!","A functionality I'd like to see, either as a default setting or new strict mode options is to not be able to delete or modify an active profile. It doesn't make sense to me to set a timer for strict mode. I'd rather either want to 1) schedule strict mode to coincide with a profile, or 2) automatically have strict mode during an active profile. Maybe a profile option can ask if we want to have strict mode turned on when that profile is active.","I contacted them about a problem with still being able to access blocked apps. Haven't heard back yet. If that one little thing could be fixed, it'd be perfect Edit: I still haven't heard back from you 2nd edit: I was asked to make a video of the problem. I took pics, thought that was enough"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"cz.mobilesoft.appblock","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.mobilesoft.appblock&hl=en&gl=au"}
