I like the multiple choices for control over the apps. I like the multiple provide groups. NOTE: The app is unstable and will freeze and even crash if it cannot display ads. If it has no internet access, it cannot even be configured. I often turn off my mobile data to conserve my data limit when I don't need internet and don't want apps consuming data without my permission. Any app that is unstable offline is an app I won't keep. Too bad, it has promise.","Well done guys!!!!! It was really very helpful. The usage tracker is awesome.....it helped me realize that I really waste so much of time on my phone","The app blocker stay focused no distractions app : the app blocker stay focused no distractions app is the best app blocker ever and it works really well to block unwanted apps and keeps me away from porn and blocks the unfiltered build in web browsers and the unrestricted YouTube app thank you Google play store app.","Just downloaded this amazing application.
