This is just like old browsing exprience of chrome browser.... Don't copy that.... If you want to be best... Plzz make your own idea... Use different browser feature like... One of my favourite browser like Jiopages, or Brave browser... Which help you to make a unique browsering app ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰. And at last don't make onle Google as a Default, give a feature to select other search engine like.. Microsoft Bing, Duck Duck Go, Qmamu(indian) search engine.ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³","Give an update that will enable pages to refresh on swiping downward. You have given last update in 2017. For what you have been waiting for","Fast, reliable, solid browsing. Not perfect but does what if says and more.","Everything is Good... but we have few problems. 1.) It's impossible to delete download history, everyone can see what you have downloaded. 2.) When the device is on landscape mode and you want to search something in any website. Keyboard cover the search part \"which is in that website\" and you can't see what you're writing. 3.) It CANNOT download bigger files, it's a shame. Though everything else is Good, update please.","Fast on my Samsung Tablet A. I like the simplicity of the UI. I wish I could make the Bookmarks tab the homepage. One of the few browser that do have and EXIT button. Thank you!!! Moreover it does not beg you for a 5 star rating. There is not even a menu item to do that from the app. I gave the app 5 stars but I am finding that you cannot import bookmarks from a simple html file (pretty much all major browser have that option). A little disappointment, I hoped to use it as my default browser...PS 040719..This app is not updated and I am starting to get messages about it not being supported (ebay). The last update is from 2017. No reason to invest time and energy to this app anymore. 1 star"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mebrowser.webapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mebrowser.webapp&hl=en&gl=au"}
