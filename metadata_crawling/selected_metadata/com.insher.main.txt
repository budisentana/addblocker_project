I have to keep going back and enabling it. It's almost more annoying than just hitting skip ad Edit: I do not have battery saver enabled and I gave tried restarting my device as well. I also tried reinstalling the app. I'm still having the same issues. Its really a bummer because it seems to work fine for everyone else","Did skip YouTube ads for a week or two but now it does nothing Auto enable is on always and battery saver doesn't turn it off because it's not allowed to shut ad skipper off. Restarting phone makes no difference either. Ads keep running not only 1 but if there is more than 1 they all will play. Sometimes if there are 3 then there's 2 minutes of ads.","It worked great for a bit but now it won't skip if it's in landscape mode.","Needs: turn ON animations and turn OFF accessibility flash. Why do I have to turn animations on?? Super slows the phone down. And flash accessibility?? I need for my disability!! Same problem as Auto Skip Ads Pro. Samsung disables our phones and their store apps with Every update. UNINSTALLED.","It does skip ads but there are still areas which can be improved. Such as when I minimise the video it won't skip the ad and also that it only lasts for around a week then I gotta restart my phone again.. so that's quite annoying"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.insher.main","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insher.main&hl=en&gl=au"}
