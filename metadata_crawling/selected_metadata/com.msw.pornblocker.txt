{"title":"Pure Web - The First Porn Blocker","description":"Pure Web provides the easiest way to block all porn content and adult websites.\r\nThe fastest and the simplest porn blocking app, that you can use right now!\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a proper solution to block pornography and all of the adult content - You've reached the right place.\r\n\r\nImportant: Some internet service providers not allow to use web filters. If you are facing this issue, contact your ISP to find a solution.\r\n\r\nPure Web is a DNS-based filter that prevents adult content from being loaded.\r\n\r\nDNS filtering – is a technique of blocking access to certain websites, webpages, or IP addresses. When you attempt to access a website, a DNS query will be performed. Your DNS server will look up the IP address of the domain/webpage, which will allow a connection to be made between the browser and the server where the website is hosted. With DNS filtering in place, rather than the DNS server returning the IP address if the website exists, the request will be subjected to certain controls. This process then provides an opportunity for using DNS as a very basic, low-latency (fast!), and low-bandwidth filter to protect your family from adult websites. The filter protects your network by only providing lookup requests with a valid IP address for safe websites, but returns a local IP address to deliver a block page for forbidden sites.\r\n\r\nWe are offering 7-Day FREE Trial for new subscribers to evaluate our services, then only $2/month!\r\n\r\nEverything you need to protect your family:\r\n\r\nPassword protection\r\nSet the password after the installation and you will be able to control the access to the settings and the capabilities of your app.\r\n\r\nBlack / White list\r\nYou can block or allow access to any website that you like!\r\n\r\nBlocking history\r\nPure Web will record what websites are blocked and you can easily check the blocking history.\r\n\r\nUninstall Protection\r\nTo protect the app from unauthorized removal by the child, you can use \"Uninstall protection\" option.\r\n\r\nUsing our easy-to-use app you can block access to all porn sites and protect your child from adult content on the Internet that your child should not see.

So this blocker is pretty helpful :)","Pure Web is one of the best p0rn blockers available. Reason No. 1: Many apps state that they can't be uninstalled, but I have found that most of them are quite easy to uninstall. With the Pure Web app, I have found that it really can't be uninstalled. Reason No. 2: I find the app interface to be clean and efficient. It simply blocks adult sites as an entire category across your device, and all browsers. You can also add sites to the blacklist, if needed (sites like Reddit, etc). It's great.","Excellent application, really very useful in necessary. The Internet is a good tool, but there is a lot of inappropriate content on it. Thanks to this wonderful explanation my family can navigate calmly.","this application is very good, i've used it for a while now and it blocks everything, i always used to get disturbing ads or websites but now after downloading this app... everything is gone.","Does what it suppose to do nut in also slows down everything else. I have 5 bars amd 5 g internet and everything is loading slow. Sports websites,offer up and everything is slowing down. Sometimes i feel like im on dial up. Please fix this or contact me if there is anything that i can do to make this better.
