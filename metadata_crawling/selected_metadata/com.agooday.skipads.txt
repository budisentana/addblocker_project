This app can't tell if your settings already allow for it. So whenever you open it, it disables itself until you \"enable\" it in settings by removing its permissions, closing the app, opening it, and then re-enabling them. I have to do this every time I open this darn app. FIX THIS","I don't like that for the app to even open it demands full access to phone including \"able to read all content on the screen and draw over other apps\" what exactly does it read? As apps in past asked tbis and hacked all my accounts as they could see every text every call every email and passwords etc.","Great work, just one thing you might wanna know. Out of nowhere the app got disabled. I never disabled it, I use android and some apps you are able to disable and make it not show up, usually only for built in apps like google, this app is not one of them, it literally doesn't let me disable the app, but somehow it got disabled, don't worry it let me re enable it. Maybe the YouTube app itself disabled it. Google and Samsung are partnered so I wouldn't be surprised if Google did some wack stuff.","This has quickly become my favorite app i watch a lot of YouTube videos and this little app is a god send it deletes the ads that up til now we have been forced to watch it doesn't do away with the ads it quickly turns them off i mean in milliseconds i will always keep this app on my devices. If u hate being bothered by ads this is the app for you.","WARNING! DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP!. They want full control of your phone(I own a samsung note 10). I been using this app for about 3-4 weeks and even just a few hours ago and it was working fine But now it won't work anymore they want full control and be able to see all my data! NOT COOL! THIS MOST DEFINITELY SMELLS LIKE A SCAM OF SOME TYPE. just press the skip bottom youself or download a different app. skip this one!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.agooday.skipads","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agooday.skipads&hl=en&gl=au"}
