The one feature that they lack is that of blocking spam texts. This app block that spam, but I can always go back and look at the blocked texts to see if anything important slip through the cracks. Nothing I have found in the spam box was anything I needed to see. So congratulations on a great app I would highly recommend it to anyone. I get sick and tired of spam phone calls and spam texts get this app!!","So far it seems like its going to be a good app so I invested the 3 dollars for this month. I will continue to pay if it stops the spam like its supposed to. I am very happy how it lets you block mail from all unknown numbers, unknown group texts, and sms email txts. That is exactly what I am looking for in app. I have this blocking texts so now I have some piece of mind.","I emailed their support 3 times before they responsed. Also it's not good at filtering Spam. I still get random texts to my inbox. While sometimes it blocks people I have in my contact list ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The pictures of the contacts are often not the right person. It's buggy but the saving grace is it blocks my Ex text, without blocking phone calls.","3/7 Update: App won't let me send gif thru Sboard because it is \"too big\". No Customer Support. Sends multiple notifications for the same text message. Notifications don't disappear once text is viewed. So far so good, the app did not like when I tried using GBoard to send a Gif, I had to revert back to Samsung Keyboard but it is filtering out the SPAM text messages.","SMS spam block works fine so far. It does a nice filtering job (but requires paid version). However as for using as a main text message app, it lacks many features and have some bugs. It has potential but still feels like a beta app to me."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.smsBlocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smsBlocker&hl=en&gl=au"}
