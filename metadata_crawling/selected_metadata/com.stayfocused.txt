But when it blocks, Stay allows me to edit the profile and put it in Por App mode (even in strict mode). This gives me the possibility to continue to procastinate in other apps outside what time is up. If you blocked that possibility, it would be very useful. In addition, Stay Focused is excellent!","The app has many great fearures- especially allowing you to block opening selected apps until you do use educational apps. My issue comes in the frequently, and at random, this stops working making it so none of the resteictions are in place. This defetes the whole reason for using this app- both the paid version I use and the free version I installed on one of my children's devices.","It's great because 'unblocking' apps is a faff which means you actually adhere to your own rules. Other apps you just switch between blocked and unblocked and that's like telling a kid they can't get at the sweets because 'you put them in a drawer' lol","It's effective, I think that I less playing phone now and love it ! It's very strict that I can't open my my media social during it being blocked. The only problem is to get the best experience, you need to update to pro.Well, I don't have much money to do that. Other than that, I love this app,very very!!!! If you want to focus on study or work you should download this app!!!","I have been using this app since last 2 days. I have free version, and I have blocked youtube during my working hours. It has blocked YouTube and gives me details no. of attempts done to open this app. Now I feel some dizziness as I was addicted to YouTube. However, since last 2 days, I have seen improvement in work delivery. Great app for those who has very hard addiction of social media."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.stayfocused","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stayfocused&hl=en&gl=au"}
