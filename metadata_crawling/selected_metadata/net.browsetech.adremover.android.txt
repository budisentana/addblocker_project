When you email them, they give you a no which is never reachable.","I have just signed on to Ad Remover without being shown the cost of the subscription nor was I advised that Firefox was ,as it appears, mandatory. I am very happy with Google Chrome and do not want to add Firefox to my system. This compulsory demand to have Firefox is unstated in the sign on and is deceptive as id the lack of any indication of the cost. I do not wish to change my browser and do not therefore want to have Ad remover on my system if it can only be done by using Firefox. I ask for a refund and do not want this Ad Remover under the circumstances you demand. Garry Scarf Sydney Australia","Does not work on Samsung Android mobile...!! Even after many emails exchanged with the help desk, no improvement...I have given up!","Ad Remover DOES NOT WORK ON ANDROID BECAUSE - \"Just to let you know that the Ad Remover will not be able to work on Google Chrome for Mobile Devices and that is because the maker of Google Chrome block third extension from chrome which does not allow person to blocks ads. The reason why they do that is because chrome for phones is strictly business and that is how the maker of Google Chrome make their money. That will never charge at all so that is why we recommend customers to us Firefox and not Google Chrome\" - as advised by akeem.whyte in response to my contacting them about this same issue.","This programme was paid for to use 5 devices but when trying to load the app on the android device we are being forced to use firefox and we do not want firefox on this android. Certainly not ideal business management as this criteria was not mentioned at time if purchase. Therefore we will consider cancelling our subscripition when it expires"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"net.browsetech.adremover.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.browsetech.adremover.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
