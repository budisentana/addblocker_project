It has no pictures when you browse the web! This really helps avoide accidental exposure. You can block as many apps as you want. When click on something or search something suspicious it immediately blocks it and gives you encouragement to go take a cold shower, or go to the gym or take a walk. God bless you for being a vital tool for God to help us seek sexual purity and REAL INTIMACY! Keep it up! Hello my app displays a black screen when I open it how can I stop this?","Very easy to use app that does a great job in replacing other browsers that are not as safe and detail oriented in helping you achieve your goals. Greatful for this app. Thanks","It has been so helpful with addictive tendencies. I love the app blocking, there are times when I have cravings but it feels impossible to get to any images or websites. If used correctly can be a big help.","Your app has stopped working and is not blocking YouTube or Google any longer. Will you be fixing it? Seems to be working again today.","Fast, with amazing settings. Approaching an app besides the typical chrome, safari or another major web browser always comes with skepticism but this app is legit, and best of all, the default anti-porn settings are pretty good. Add to it that you can list your own key words and phrases to block adult content and you're good. As always, don't always trust an app. Place other barriers to keep you from engaging in pornography. Anyways, I give this app a 10/10."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.porn.blocker.purity.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.porn.blocker.purity.browser&hl=en&gl=au"}
