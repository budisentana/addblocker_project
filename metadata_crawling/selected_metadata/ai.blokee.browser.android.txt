Also you should work on download file location folder. Add SD card and phon storage. In every good browser has this option. I think your browser will be number 1 browser if you work on downloading system too. In my opinion, you should add video downloading feature like UC browser. You should set download location features like 1dm. After adding all this feature, people can find all in one browser.","Amazing app üëç well done for those developers who made it. But only one small thing is after start playing something in YouTube we can't minimize and listen to the YouTube in the background. Other than that it's perfect better than adblock browser!!","So far will not work on sites for video watching free such as Primewire. In order to watch anything on Primewire, it requires i turn off adblocker. Which is then useless, as Primewire, while having great movies. Has the worst, never ending pop ups! Not sure if it'll work on youtube though.","works really well, couldn't find many bugs or issues with the browser, blocks ads and makes using the internet a bit better without all the ads everywhere 10/10, would recommend","Really good, however there is just one small problem. Everytime I'm trying to browse or I tap a part of my screen on a site it redirects me to an unwanted source. Please add a redirect blocker to the settings."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"ai.blokee.browser.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.blokee.browser.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
