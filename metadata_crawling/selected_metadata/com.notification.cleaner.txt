Very annoying when you have many apps, as you have to block each individually, which makes it time consuming.","Worst app ever! As soon as I added it, I started getting more junk and spam text than ever. I removed it today and I have not had any weird spam messages in at least 2 hour. This app Is spam magnet. Never again.","I have only had it for a little while. Not even a full day, but I have already found that this app has blocked 48 spam messages. It is a great app. I highly recommend that you try it. So far, I have not experienced any glitches or anything like that, but I will edit this message in the future if I do.","This is an Awsome site. Ever since yesterday when i downloaded this app, my pop up spam and went from non stop spam and robo calls, to ZERO pop ups and robo calls, but now that i have this app, i will never get rid of it. Thank you for an AWSOME spam and robo blocker.
