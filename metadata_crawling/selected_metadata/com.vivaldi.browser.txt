Desktop or mobile, Vivaldi is my go-to. It's highly customizable, fast, and syncs nicely (most of the time) with my desktop. The team at Vivaldi include many small quality of life improvements that make this browser worth using, too. All in all, an excellent browser! Thanks Vivaldi!","Love the browser, but I always had problems to open pdf dokuments (only a blank page shows), but the documents where there you just have to open them with a different app. But since a few days i can't download pdfs. Every download works except pdfs. I just get an error. With another browser it works, seems to be a problem with vivaldi","Best Browser... Period! Edit: I have, and That's a Fact! The desktop version is Unreal... the options are Awesome! Complete control of your user experience... fantastic everything! Most of all... in my opinion it's by far the Safest and most secure browser available! (And No... I didnt het anything for the review... lol... it's just Awesome!)","Spectacular browser on windows, blink engine spoofs! ...Please make this have an option (least optionable) to have the browser tabs and/or address bar at the bottom, as in address bar bottom or top and tabs with same choice like the windows version, its why i came here on android as with a phone it just makes sense to have it lower, within reach, least the address bar if not both or even one or other so don't drop phone trying to ....reach upward often ... so high! also, keep Secure!! Thanks, S","hi, i recently updated, and now i get a white line when i open websites i have pinned as webapps in my launcher... The white line is of course only notisable in dark mode. Please fix this for me, and add support for android system picture selector instead of the vivaldi selector, it keeps crashing when i try to select pictures to upload."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.vivaldi.browser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vivaldi.browser&hl=en&gl=au"}
