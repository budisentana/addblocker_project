The blocked apps mode allows you to choose a list of apps you want blocked during the lockout. The allowed apps mode allows you to choose a list of apps you want to allow during the lockout. The most strict is the lock screen only mode, which only allows use of the lock screen. You can still answer calls or call emergency numbers in lock screen only mode.\r\n \r\nUsage based lockouts\r\nConfigure rules that will trigger an automatic lockout based on your device usage. With usage based lockouts enabled, total screen time, usage of apps, and number of unlocks will be monitored. You can set up usage rules that trigger a lockout based on total screen time, time spent in specific apps, number of times specific apps are opened, or number of device unlocks. Usage rules can be scheduled to only be enforced at certain times.\r\n \r\nScheduled lockouts\r\nSet up lockouts that repeat regularly on a schedule. You can choose the start and end time, the days of the week, the lockout mode, and additional options for each scheduled lockout.\r\n \r\nOne-time lockout\r\nQuickly start a one-time lockout for today. You can set a custom duration, lock until a certain clock time, or schedule a lockout for later on.\r\n \r\nLockout options\r\nEach lockout has its own configurable options. The lockout can turn on Do Not Disturb (DND), silence the ringer, block websites, or only begin the lockout at chosen physical locations. DND is important to helps us eliminate frequent interruptions, which is vital for our focus, productivity, and mental health. Having lockouts limited to specific physical locations can improve focus while at school, the gym, or anywhere else apps can be a distraction. The website blocker works well when you don't want to block the entire browser app.\r\n \r\nAdditional settings\r\nThere are many additional options on the settings screen to fine tune the app to your liking.\r\n \r\nPremium version\r\nThe free version is limited to 5 lockouts, 10 chosen apps, 5 blocked websites, and 5 lockout locations. The premium version has no limitations. Please consider upgrading to support future development! We want everyone to conquer their addiction. If you cannot afford the premium version, please email us.","descriptionHTML":"<h4><b>Can&#39;t put your phone down? Are you addicted to your smartphone?

Had an issue with the password, emailed the support address and got it sorted. I've tried other apps like this but this one is the most effective as it works even after restarting your phone, something which the others don't do. Love the option to schedule lockouts and the usage based one. If you need an app to help manage phone usage get this one 👍","No app had worked for me before, each time I had to pay to use the app and it was much too easy to stop a session of concentration whenever I wanted. This app really prevents you from doing what you shouldn't be doing, has many features and a very cleverly made UI. Congratulations to the team 👏","Edit: Updates have greatly improved the app, and I rely on it daily. If you're looking for a lock-out solution, this is The One. --------- This app almost did what I needed it to do. It has a great interface, and I wanted to love it, but the usage time is only in hours. I need it to lock me out after I use my phone for 20 minutes, and it doesn't let me do that.","this is really awesome. this has all the options i needed( block on specific time, block by usage or put password on the app itself). it's free aswell and i really benefited from it. it's not too cluttered and pretty simple to use. i recommend you atleast try it cause I'm happy i did😄👍","pretty good app to prevent yourself from using some app or site. there's a \"prevent tampering\" feature that I appreciate a lot, but unfortunately, it's not working fully. If you grant admin rights and accessibility service, the app prevents disabling the lock. however, the accessibility service permission isn't watched, so you can disable that, and the lock is circumvented. any chance you can add a blocking mechanism for the accessibility service permission too?"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.teqtic.lockmeout","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teqtic.lockmeout&hl=en&gl=au"}
