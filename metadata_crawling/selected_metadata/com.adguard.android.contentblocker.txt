I wanted to block ads on mobile web sites for weather -- major players like AccuWeather, The Weather Channel, etc. They're so clogged with ads, it's awful. Unfortunately, this app didn't block a single ad for me on those sites. It could be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I'll never know because it didn't work for me. Uninstalled.","I didn't actually use it. It only works on 2 special browsers, both I've never heard of before. Sounds like it works? But otherwise (as far as I can tell) it only works on two browsers you likely won't have installed. No mobile apps, not Google or Safari. 乁( •_• )ㄏ","Great protection! Great value. It says and does what it needs to do to protect you and your surfing. The only issue I came up with is when you allow the VPN authentication, sometimes your WiFi experience will suffer. Instead of the 250+ down, I'd get 30 or less. I narrowed it down to that authentication. When I deleted it and restarted the phone I get normal speeds now. It occurred twice when experimenting with that particular certificate for VPN. Play with it. With or without VPN, it's an A","It's a good browser app and Adblocker. Not bad on the computer, but good with mobile. As long as you spend a little time setting up the basics, you'll get a good ad-free experience. Just remember to also add your trusted sites as you go along.","Stops ALL the adverts on you tube, don't know about other sites as that is all I use it for you have to use the Samsung browser too in order for it to work, it stops every single advert either before or during anyclip watched, if like me you thought the adverts were embedded in YouTube THEY ARE NOT it is Google that put them on there are so by using the Samsung browser and this app you will never see them again it has made a world of difference to viewing YouTube!!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.adguard.android.contentblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adguard.android.contentblocker&hl=en&gl=au"}
