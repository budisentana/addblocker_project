It is really great in terms of performance. It searches using the DDG search engine and no other search engine is there yet, but it delivers just as much. The privacy? Best just one button (and two clicks) and boom all your browsing, password etc are deleted. Overall Great App!!","I love this browser, it does what you need it to as far as privacy is concerned and I appreciate that it blocks ads really well. I just wish you could stop videos from auto play but other than that, no complaints from me. Great app!","It works fine for me. Supplies more informstion than it used to but that was years ago. I like the privacy factor and the guiding emails to more privacy. Keep up the good work !! Thank you ðŸ˜€","Love it! Very easy to use. Finally no annoying ads or repetitive stories like I was getting with Chrome. I will keep using it.","Thanks for fixing the refresh sensitivity issue, but I still wish there was an option to turn it off. Emailed that feedback to you."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.duckduckgo.mobile.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&hl=en&gl=au"}
