Locking makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible****, for the filter to be shutdown or the app uninstalled.  (if you get locked out, email support@truple.io and I can provide you with an unlock pin good for 24 hours).\r\n• (Premium) Set a delay (5 mins - 72 hours) before unlocking the filter.\r\n\r\n* Certain apps with proxies built in may not be filtered.  For these apps use the app blocker to prevent access to them.\r\n** Customized filters can conflict with each other if multiple devices with different filter customizations use the same internet connection at the same time. \r\n*** US and Canadian mobile numbers only for SMS alerts.  Rolling limit of 100 total messages in a 31 day period.  You will be alerted if you go over the limit.  This should be a sufficient amount, but if you find it isn't please contact androidfilter@truple.io.\r\n**** Filter locking is designed for stock android OS.  If your device uses a highly modified android OS, it may not work properly.  Contact androidfilter@truple.io with any questions.\r\n\r\nIf you find the app stops on it's own, please see https://dontkillmyapp.com?app=Truple%20Web%20Filter for instructions to adjust app permissions to ensure it runs properly.  This isn't necessary for stock android.\r\n\r\nPremium features require a subscription of $5 / month ($4.17 / month if paid annually).\r\n\r\nSome internet service providers (ISP) may block the DNS filtering service.  Unfortunately the only people who can \"fix\" this are your network administrators and/or your ISP.\r\n\r\nIf an app stops working while the filter is running, then whitelist that app!  Some apps have been permanently white-listed already.\r\n\r\nPlease Note\r\n• You cannot use another VPN and the filter at the same time.\r\n• Truple filter is not a full-fledged VPN, and will not encrypt all of your traffic.\r\n• If you have issues clicking the \"ok\" button on the VPN dialog asking if you'd like to connect, please check that you don't have any screen overlays on, as they can impact your ability to click the \"ok\" button.\r\n\r\nThis app uses Accessibility services.  It uses the BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE permission in order to lock the filter and prevent unauthorized attempts to bypass the lock.\r\n\r\nThis app uses the Device Administrator permission.  The Device Administrator permission is used to prevent \"force stop\" and \"uninstall\" attempts when the filter is locked.","descriptionHTML":"Truple - Porn Filter is a lightweight DNS filter that runs as a VPN service.  <br><br><b>Features:</b><br>• Blocks adult content sites, phishing sites, and optionally mixed content sites (using adult + mixed filter)<br>• Works across entire phone, including browsers, apps, etc.*<br>• Filters incognito mode / private browser modes<br>• Runs on startup<br>• Safe search enforced on most search engines (using adult + mixed filter)<br>• <b>(Premium) Customize the filter and block/allow custom websites**</b><br>• (Premium) VPN auto-reconnect<br>• (Premium) App blocker<br>• <b>(Premium) Send an email/text message alert to a friend</b> when filter is locked/unlocked***, or when the VPN service is forcibly shutdown<br>• (Premium) Use a Pin to lock the filter.

Answer to your question: Yes there is a reason... Big thumbs... Changed it to 5! Thanks again for a great app that works well and blocks out everything, thankfully.","I want to start by saying thank you to the devs for this blessing of an app. The fact that this is free at all is amazing - I'm truly grateful for it. The only thing I wish Truple would do is add keyword blocking. If Truple would add this in addition to it's other features I would happily pay for premium - with this, it would be the all around best internet filter available. Hands down. No other apps have gotten keyword blocking right yet. Plz do this if you can! Thank you!","Particularly once you lock the filter, this is one of the only apps that seem to really work. It's worth the $5. You will still want to black Accessibility Suite if your phone has that, or in some way limit settings page to prevent accessibility from turning off.","Not only is this is best porn filter i have tried, it also contains the only app locker i have found that will lock the accessibility settings, allowing me to permanently put my phone in Grayscale. Highly recommend grayscale. Even if i do stumble upon something arousing, if its in black and white its far less stimulating and far less likely to dig its claws into me. Also great for general phone addiction.","Great app and does what it claims. I would recommend just paying the $50 for a year's worth of protection. It supports the app developer and is extremely hard to bypass once in extreme mode."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.camhart.pornblocker","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.camhart.pornblocker&hl=en&gl=au"}
