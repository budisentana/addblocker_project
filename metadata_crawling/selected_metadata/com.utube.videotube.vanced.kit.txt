One glaring issue I have had is that there is seemingly no way to disable autoplay. I have the setting turned off but videos continue to be automatically queued up. As someone who uses Youtube to go to sleep, I dont want videos to be playing nonstop until I get up. If this bug is fixed, I will rate 5 stars as I have no further complaints.","This would be a great app if: 1. I could comment and like/dislike vids. 2. Autoplay is OFF, but another vid automatically plays at the end & the next video can blast you with higher volume. Annoying. 3. You cannot see whether you have already watched a video. Youtube has a bottom red line to indicate this. In Vanced, Youtube vids all look 'unwatched'. 4. In landscape mode the brightness gets automatically dimmed A LOT, like watching vids events happening during a hurricane. That dark! Pls fix.TY","It's amazing! I have a suggestion allow us to change the color scheme of the lettering on the app like maybe you can make the lettering purple or maybe multicolored like your apps color scheme. (edit): I think you guys should make it where it will stay in landscape if you're using land scape cause I hate having to turn my device every time it switches after watching a video","I really like the app and generally don't have any complaints. The interface is smooth, responsive and pretty unique, which I really enjoy. The lack of ads are only a second plus. Just a note for the creators: be very careful. YouTube and google will no doubt be on your backs on this, if they aren't already. Stay on your guards and try to make everything seem more unique. It'll better your case if it comes around.","I would rate it higher but i can't give likes and comments which is a crucial part of my interaction with the YouTube platform. Another feature that i would love to see added is the ability to customize the navigation buttons below the search bar. I really dont care for the trending page for example and would love for the first thing that shows up when i open the app to be my subscribsions instead of the homepage feed."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.utube.videotube.vanced.kit","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.utube.videotube.vanced.kit&hl=en&gl=au"}
