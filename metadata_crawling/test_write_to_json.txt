Happy copy and pasting!","comments":["I was hoping the new version of Firefox improved bookmarks, but they made it even worse. You still can't rearrange bookmarks without jumping through a ton of hoops, but now they're not even on the home page, you have to go through two clicks minimum to get to them. That may not sound like much, but it can get very tiresome when going through a lot of bookmarks. At least you can still install Noscript to help avoid bad sites and tracking.","Decent browser. Very glitchy, especially when launching links from the browser into native apps--when you come back the browser leaves a dead page with an error link. Has no built in translator tool. It's honestly a pretty weak showing from Mozilla. But it has an absolute killer ad-blocker available if you can deal with the glitches and low functionality.","Longtime user, quick and easy to use securely and developing more and quickly. I appreciate the net effect of user-friendliness - unlike many in sheep's clothes! Easy to take for granted, taking time to tweak and peruse newly developed add-ons keeps it fascinatingly fresh and \"state of the moment\" in an era of everything also updating. Also? Levels for different purposes and intent - seductively thoroughly engaging.","Firefox has now achieved a state of grace where I can use it again. One important privacy feature has been left out of the current version, however: the ability to turn off one's browsing history. If shortcuts are enabled on the home page, the history keeps piling up as shortcuts like so many calling cards of adult workers littering the streets of Vegas. Yeah. That bad. Mozilla, give me the option of turning off my history like I had for 20 years before this ludicrous fakakte.","Man, wouldn't it be crazy if Firefox overwrites files with the same name OUTSIDE of the downloads folder? I can't count the amount of times I just downloaded a picture, moved it into a new folder, and then discover months later that a file that is also named 1(2).png replaced it that was definitely in the downloads folder (but now in the new folder). No other browser does this, I don't get why this has to be an issue when renaming a file more than once should be the norm."],"appId":"org.mozilla.firefox","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&hl=en&gl=us"}
