Don’t settle for a browser produced by giant, profit-driven, data-hoarding tech companies. Firefox is the obvious choice for independent, ethical tech that respects your privacy and gives you more ways than ever before to tailor your internet experience exactly the way you want it. <br><br>Firefox is backed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. When you make Firefox your go-to, everyday browser, you’re also joining a unique (serious nerd cred) community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  <br><br>Firefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. <br><br>We want you to have an amazing experience every time you use Firefox. We know feeling safe and secure are foundational for enjoying your time online. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than you do about profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.<br><br><b>DIFFERENT DEVICES.

In addition to synced tabs and searches, Firefox also makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.<br><br><b>PRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES</b><br>Firefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, crypto-miners and fingerprinters. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.<br><br><b>EASY PASSWORD MANAGEMENT</b><br>Firefox makes password management simple by generating unique passwords and remembering them across devices. <br><br><b>FIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR</b><br>Get search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most.

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.<br><br>Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.","scoreText":"4.8","score":4.754794},{"title":"Tor Browser","appId":"org.torproject.torbrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.torbrowser","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/riCYzcp6mWqbcIY8lT3tlIpKaIFvRA_twgDjrJpJtWFv4OJnD2tka8iuMhXSJbAzRJ8","developer":"The Tor Project","currency":"USD","price":0,"free":true,"summary":"Tor Browser for Android is the only official mobile browser supported by the Tor Project, developers of the world’s strongest tool for privacy and freedom online. <br><br>Tor Browser will ALWAYS be free, but donations make it possible.

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.<br><br>Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.","scoreText":"4.7","score":4.7455425},{"title":"Oko VPN","appId":"com.okovpn.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.okovpn.app","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/epR2GNzhc42zpmHWSFJ1seD_V13iJqVGMaQGKi_so3X8BjFSM0lG2SUB7fKJh5vhF_s","developer":"VIP Internet Security LTD","currency":"USD","price":0,"free":true,"summary":"All of your traffic is encrypted while using this app. It protects your privacy, identity and allows you to browse the web safely without the fear of being tracked by hackers or trackers.
