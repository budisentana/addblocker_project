Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.<br><br>Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.","scoreText":"4.7","score":4.7455425},{"title":"Private Browser-Incognito&Safe","appId":"com.hsv.privatebrowser","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hsv.privatebrowser","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a0ZEoe3yeGWodMMXzousc49h_Wu2yZ4RnEd-zI7qFQFw4ZBu3B8EVnzrYbSTmFZhass3","developer":"Adblock – Rocketshield Browser Technology Limited","currency":"USD","price":0,"free":true,"summary":"<b>Private Browser is completely free and enables you to have a private and anonymous web experience.</b> The incognito mode ensures your browsing history is not recorded and can be deleted.
