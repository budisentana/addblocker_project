Download Firefox now.<br><br>When you use Firefox, you’re helping support Mozilla, which is backed by a non-profit foundation whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. We know there are a lot of choices out there, some of them produced by huge tech companies, but in choosing Firefox you’re joining a unique community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  <br><br>Firefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. <br>Recently, a lot of internet browsers started talking about their new and improved privacy features, and we think that’s great. But for us, privacy isn’t the latest buzzword in the browser business. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than you do about profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.<br><br><b>STREAMLINED HOME SCREEN</b><br>Pick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.<br><br><b>FAST. PRIVATE. SAFE.</b><br>Keep what’s personal private without sacrificing speed. With Firefox, you can have more control to decide what to share online and when. We designed Firefox with smart browsing features that let you take your privacy, password and bookmarks with you wherever you go.<br><br><b>MAKE FIREFOX YOUR OWN</b><br>Make Firefox your go-to, get-it-done, default browser. And with Firefox widgets, you can jump right to searching the web or using private-browsing mode straight from your phone’s home screen.<br><br><b>PRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES</b><br>Firefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, crypto-miners and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to “strict” blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.<br><br><b>SEAMLESS BROWSING ACROSS DEVICES</b><br>Add Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. Sync your devices and send open tabs between mobile and desktop. Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.<br><br><b>FIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR</b><br>Get search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.<br><br><b>GET ADD-ONS</b><br>Full support for the most popular add-ons, including ways to turbo-charge powerful default privacy settings and customize your experience.<br><br><b>ORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE</b><br>Create as many tabs as you like without losing track.

When you leave our search engine to use other sites and apps, we aim to block as many hidden trackers as possible, but we can&#39;t block them all for a few reasons. New trackers emerge all the time, so first we need to find them. Then, blocking these trackers can sometimes break functionality, so we need to develop new approaches without hurting usability. Additionally, in our app we offer a specific type of protection that stops scripts from even loading on 3rd-party sites, which isn’t offered on most popular browsers by default. Currently, this one loading protection doesn&#39;t apply to Microsoft scripts on 3rd-party sites due to contractual restrictions. However, our other tracker blocking methods (like 3rd-party cookie blocking) are unrestricted and continue to work against these trackers to protect your privacy online.<br><br>About Us: https://duckduckgo.com/about <br>How It Works: https://duckduckgo.com/app <br>Privacy Newsletter: https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter <br>Privacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy <br>Open Source: https://github.com/duckduckgo/android"

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.<br><br>Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network."

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.<br><br>Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network."

org.adw.launcher,ADW Launcher 2,"You may think the original and best launcher of all time has not been updated, because people assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but *actually* from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it’s more like we released this update 3 years ago and you didn’t realize. Don’t worry, we understand not everyone has…1.21 gigawatts!! to spend.<br><br>Having said this, we’ve been reading a lot about Google recommendations on abusing app options and settings, and we’ve talked a lot about it. But as the ability to speak does not make us intelligent we’ve made all the opposite. You know, without freedom of choice there is no creativity. The Launcher bores.<br>You may also think “I find your excess of settings disturbing” and we don’t blame you! It’s a totally normal reaction. I guess you guys aren’t ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. In the end, the possibility of configuring it to your likeness is approximately 3720 to 1, what makes it the best launcher because maths never lie.<br><br>And yeah, we have screens, ¿and icons? for sure, ahh and we have widgets too, what more?, I mean what else?, in fact, you can make your own. And if you prefer getting everything pre-made, use themes! Or widget and template packs! ¿Is your device’s desktop boring? Change it again Sam. Your style, your rules, Do. Or do not, there’s a setting for it, tweak it, change it, shaken, not stirred.<br><br>And remember, “There’s no such thing as ‘the unknown,’ only options inside ADW Settings”<br><br>¿Are you gonna miss it?<br><br><br>*Endless Features*<br><br>Most of the application have been reprogrammed and redesigned from scratch. Also we have added a lot of new features. Here are some of them:<br><br>* Support for Android 7.1 launcher shortcuts (limited support on older versions down to 5.x)<br>* Added new icons effects section. You can choose image filters and compositions. Awesome!!!<br>* Dynamic UI coloring using wallpaper colors.<br>* New way to manage screens. Hold down an empty area of the desktop.<br>* New way to add widgets and shortcuts.<br>* New way to change the wallpaper, lock/unlock the desktop or access settings. Hold down an empty area of the desktop and choose the option.<br>* Added fast scroll app drawer style.<br>* Added indexed fast scroll app drawer style.<br>* Added some desktop transitions.<br>* Added new section to configure icon badges.<br>* Added a visual mode to configure desktop, icon appearance, folder appearance, and app drawer options.<br>* Added option to change the top panel/widget.<br>* Added option to change the content type of bottom panel (dock/widget).<br>* Added new wrap folder mode to folders. This mode lets you launch the first app in the folder on tap, and show the folder contents on swipe up.<br>* Added new fast application search in app drawer.<br>* Improved app categories in app drawer.<br>* Improved way to manage user gestures.<br>* Improved way to apply internal and external themes.<br>* Improved context menu for all desktop objects.<br>* Added new Custom Widget object. You can add new custom widgets from widget list, import them from friends and other developers, create, edit and share your own.<br>* Added some initial extensions for the custom widgets (time/battery)<br>* Check out ADWExtensions pack for more extensions (weather, gmail, etc).<br>* Added template manager. Remove, add and share templates easily.<br>* Improved icon properties dialog.<br>* Improved folder properties dialog.<br>* Added backup manager in advanced settings/system. Now you can import data from other famous launchers (if you miss one, report back to us so we can include it!)<br>* Added the possibility to set a secondary action on desktop shortcuts. Swipe up over the desktop shortcut to execute the secondary action.<br>* Probably 2 or 200 things I’m forgetting…<br>* A bunch of wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff inside!"

So, you can trust that it does not connect to a remote server to steal your privacy data. Please feel safe to use!<br><br>• Because this app is based on VPN framework of Android OS, so if turned it on you cannot use another VPN app at the same time and it may drain the battery.<br><br>• Some IM apps (Instant Messaging apps, such as Skype) may use Google Play services to receive the incoming messages if the app has no network. So you may also need to block &quot;Google Play services&quot; to block receiving messages for IM apps.<br><br>• Battery Optimization feature of Android OS may auto disconnect VPN apps in the sleep mode to save battery.

com.aaronjwood.portauthority.free,Port Authority - Port Scanner,"A handy systems and security-focused tool, Port Authority is a very fast port scanner. Port Authority also allows you to quickly discover hosts on your network and will display useful network information about your device and other hosts.<br><br>One of the fastest port scanners with host discovery on the market! Host discovery is typically performed in less than 5 seconds. If the device you&#39;re scanning drops packets, it takes about 10 seconds to scan 1000 ports. If the device you&#39;re scanning rejects packets, it takes less than 30 seconds to scan all 65,535 ports!<br><br>Features<br><br>* Heavily threaded, no more waiting for results one at a time<br>* LAN host discovery<br>* Public IP discovery<br>* MAC address vendor detection<br>* LAN/WAN host TCP port scanning<br>* Custom port range scans<br>* Open discovered HTTP(S) services to browser<br>* Lightweight service fingerprinting (SSH/HTTP(S) server type and version)<br>* DNS record lookups supporting almost every record type<br>* Wake-on-LAN for LAN hosts<br><br>How are scans so fast?<br><br>This application makes heavy use of threading. Because most of the operations performed are I/O bound a lot more threads can be used than the number of cores on a device. In fact, one of the most intensive parts of the application is updating the UI during scans. This has gone through many optimizations but still remains a bit of a hotspot.<br><br>I have a lower end and/or older device, will this work?<br><br>Absolutely! Just lower the number of threads that are used for port scans in the settings. I&#39;m always working on improving the efficiency and memory footprint of the application, and things have been greatly improved since the original version!<br><br>I keep getting crashes when scanning a large range of ports<br><br>The crash is most likely an out of memory exception that is occurring due to using too many threads. Lower your port scan thread count in the settings. The right value will be highly dependent on the device and its hardware.<br><br>I&#39;m getting a warning that says this application is trying to send email<br><br>A few users have reported that a warning pops up on their device, warning them that this application is trying to send mail. This is caused by various security software so you can be assured (or just look at the code yourself) that I&#39;m not sending mail.<br><br>Some security software looks at where traffic is coming and going from the device and takes certain actions for certain cases. If you&#39;re running any kind of port scan that includes port 25 (SMTP) this will most likely be flagged. Even though no data is being sent to that port the security software will see an outbound connection to an SMTP service and throw up a warning. Obviously this is a very bad check but some security tools are better than others and may actually look for data flowing out to port 25 to see if there&#39;s really anything happening.<br><br>I&#39;m not finding some of the hosts/devices on my LAN<br><br>If you&#39;re finding that some devices aren&#39;t responding in time you should increase the host scan timeout setting, just be aware that it will cause host scans to take longer. In some cases it may be worth trading time for accuracy.<br><br>I&#39;m not finding open ports that I know are truly open<br><br>You can now adjust the timeout for connections made to ports when performing either LAN or WAN scans. If you&#39;re scanning something over WAN (mobile network if you&#39;re using a cell phone) please be aware that scanning is best effort. Mobile carriers may detect that a real port scan is occurring and apply traffic shaping dynamically, or they may just start terminating the connections entirely. Additionally, if you happen to have poor signal or to not have 4G the quality of the network connection may be so poor that you&#39;ll need to have a fairly high timeout in order to tolerate latency spikes.<br><br><br>Do you like the application?

The vulnerability is particularly troublesome because it can be delivered via MMS, which is automatically downloaded to the Android device by default, giving a potential attacker the ability to remotely control and steal data from the device. Currently there is no evidence that these exploits are being used in the wild. The Stagefright vulnerability affects any Android device running Froyo 2.2 to Lollipop 5.1.1 and has been documented with the following reference numbers: CVE-2015-1538, CVE-2015-1539, CVE-2015-3824, CVE-2015-3826, CVE-2015-3827, CVE-2015-3828, CVE-2015-3829.<br><br>■ Will Stagefright Detector fix the Stagefright vulnerability?<br><br>Stagefright Detector is designed to keep you informed about the status of your device. <br>Stagefright Detector will not fix the vulnerability, because the vulnerability can only be fixed once a patch is released by Google, your carrier or your device manufacturer, which typically is delivered through a System Update.

com.parsed.securitywall,Puffer: Privacy Protection & Ad-Blocking,"Puffer protects you from the harmful trackers and malware layered throughout the Android ecosystem with just one click.<br><br>Puffer acts as a local VPN service for your device, but it does not route your traffic to a third party. Instead, the other end of the VPN connection is on your device. From there, Puffer monitors outbound connections against known lists of bad guys and prevent connections to services trying to track you.<br><br>Technical Description: Puffer is a packet-level filter for Android that uses the VPN interface to read raw packets. By registering as a VPN, Puffer can get Android to forward raw IP packets to the application instead of the network. Puffer then emulates a network card and performs complementary Linux socket operations but keeps track of TLS packets. Puffer reads the initial ClientHello packet of each TLS connection and extracts the SNI (Server Name Indication) headers, which it uses to classify and selectively block streams. By this mechanism, Puffer can block streams without needing to decrypt the stream contents.<br><br>Features:<br><br>- Unlike a standard VPN service, your data does not leave your device, so you don&#39;t need to place your trust in a compromisable third-party server!<br>- Puffer is more effective than PiHole, NextDNS and other DNS based solutions because Puffer will still work if the application uses a non-standard DNS resolver.<br>- We keep track of how many trackers we block, so you can see just how invasive your favourite websites are.<br>- You can use the provided &quot;Live View&quot; UI to see the connections that your device is making to the world, including the hostname and IP address, in real-time.<br><br>Privacy:<br>- None of the data Puffer handles will ever be stored or sent to Puffer servers, this is an entirely client-side solution.<br>- Puffer does not decrypt encrypted traffic, such as HTTPS, it only looks at traffic meta-data and patterns to spot bad requests.<br><br>Notes:<br>- If you would like Puffer to be always-on and restart with your phone you can enable this setting in your device&#39;s settings. Travel to the &quot;VPN&quot; area of the phone settings (On Samsung devices this is under &quot;More connection settings&quot;) then click the settings option next to &quot;Puffer&quot; and toggle on &quot;Always-on VPN&quot;. It is best to leave &quot;Block connections without VPN&quot; disabled.<br>- If you are having trouble with any application of the website, please reach out to me at the listed developer contact. As long as I can view the website or application from my own device, I will try and solve the issue for you.<br><br>Coming Soon:<br>- Custom blocklists.<br>- Bandwidth Meter (See which of your device connections is consuming the most bandwidth)."

Enjoy the secure virtual private network experience right now!<br><br><br><br><br>VPN introduction<br><br>A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.<br><br>Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law-enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network."

The components of the assembly can be hidden or shown as necessary to inspect the model. The selected sub-assembly or part can be queried for its properties.<br><br>CAD model (whole or selected part or sub-assembly) can be exported to any of supported CAD or mesh formats.<br><br><b>Viewing mesh data</b><br><br>Additional functionality is viewing of mesh models with associated data, implemented using the mesh visualization component of OCCT. <br><br>Supported mesh formats are: <br>- glTF is an open standard for 3D assets.<br>- STL is de-facto standard in 3D printing. <br>- PLY has capability to store data associated with mesh nodes and elements. If you have in your application a model represented by mesh, it can be saved easily to PLY format and viewed on a tablet. Additional data (RGB color or scalar) can be added to each polygon or node.<br>- OBJ is standard for 3D animation and supported by most 3D graphics applications.<br>- JT is ISO standard for efficient visualization of 3D CAD data.<br><br>CAD Assistant allows you to view the mesh in wireframe, shaded, and shrink view. If mesh contains associated textures, colors, or scalar data, it can be viewed with elements colored according to the selected property. For scalar quantities interactive color scale is shown, providing controls to manipulate the range of displayed quantities.<br><br><b>Common operations</b><br><br>CAD Assistant for Android is optimized for devices with multi-touch screen and provides intuitive manipulation of the 3D view by finger gestures.<br><br>Left toolbar provides buttons for fitting model to window and choice of standard views. Settings submenu provides access to viewer and application options, file information, and message log.<br><br>Files can be opened from local storage (internal memory or SD card). CAD Assistant integrates with Android so that applications supporting file associations will launch it for opening files of relevant types. For instance, you can open STEP file sent to you by mail by simple click on attachment in mail client.<br><br>CAD models can be saved in STEP, IGES, or BREP format as CAD data; CAD and mesh models can be saved in PLY, STL, or OBJ format as polygonal data. Save file dialog also allows saving current image of the model to PNG format. If target directory Mail is selected, the mail client will be automatically started with saved file as attachment.<br><br><b>Supported devices</b><br><br>CAD Assistant has been tested to work on a wide range of modern tablets and smartphones. Note however that it is optimized for landscape screen orientation, which might be inconvenient on phones.<br><br>Application requires OpenGL ES 3.0+.<br><br><b>Limitations</b><br><br>Depending on a device, opening large files may take time. Devices with low-range graphic processor could be slow on displaying large models, and system might (silently) close application if model requires more memory than available on device.<br><br>See more at https://www.opencascade.com/content/cad-assistant<br><br><b>Feedback</b><br><br>We welcome your feedback on Google Play or on our User Forum at https://dev.opencascade.org/forums/open-cascade-applications"
