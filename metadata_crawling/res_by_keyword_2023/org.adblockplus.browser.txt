Don‚Äôt settle for a browser produced by giant, profit-driven, data-hoarding tech companies. Firefox is the obvious choice for independent, ethical tech that respects your privacy and gives you more ways than ever before to tailor your internet experience exactly the way you want it. <br><br>Firefox is backed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. When you make Firefox your go-to, everyday browser, you‚Äôre also joining a unique (serious nerd cred) community that‚Äôs actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  <br><br>Firefox is extremely private for a reason ‚Äî and the reason is you. <br><br>We want you to have an amazing experience every time you use Firefox. We know feeling safe and secure are foundational for enjoying your time online. Since version 1 in 2004, we‚Äôve taken privacy seriously, because we‚Äôve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than you do about profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.<br><br><b>DIFFERENT DEVICES. SAME TRAIN OF THOUGHT</b><br>Now you can search for things on your laptop then pick up the exact same search on your phone and vice versa. Your Firefox homepage displays your most recent searches from your other devices so you can easily get back to what you were doing or thinking about. <br><br><b>LIMITED-EDITION WALLPAPERS</b><br>Introducing limited-edition wallpapers from independent creators. Stick with one you love or switch it up anytime to make your Firefox match your mood.<br><br><b>STREAMLINED HOME SCREEN</b><br>Pick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.<br><br><b>GET FIREFOX ON ALL YOUR DEVICES</b><br>Add Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. In addition to synced tabs and searches, Firefox also makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.<br><br><b>PRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES</b><br>Firefox gives you greater privacy protection while you‚Äôre on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, crypto-miners and fingerprinters. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.<br><br><b>EASY PASSWORD MANAGEMENT</b><br>Firefox makes password management simple by generating unique passwords and remembering them across devices. <br><br><b>FIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX‚ÄôS SEARCH BAR</b><br>Get search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously-searched results across your favorite search engines.<br><br><b>GET ADD-ONS</b><br>Full support for the most popular add-ons, including ways to turbo-charge powerful default privacy settings and customize your experience.<br><br><b>ORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE</b><br>Create as many tabs as you like without losing track.
